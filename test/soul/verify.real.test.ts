/**
 * Verification against this machine — opt-in, read-only, and costly.
 *
 * Run with:
 *
 *     OM_AGI_REAL_VERIFY=1 bun test test/soul/verify.real.test.ts
 *     OM_AGI_REAL_VERIFY=1 OM_AGI_REAL_MODEL=<ollama model> bun test test/soul/verify.real.test.ts
 *
 * Skipped otherwise. It spends a real turn on a commercial CLI and needs a
 * daemon that exists on one machine and not in CI, and a test that silently
 * passes when its subject is missing is worse than no test.
 *
 * What it cannot do is assert what a model will say — that is the thing being
 * measured, and a test that demanded a particular answer would be a test of the
 * fixture's luck. So it asserts the properties that must hold *whatever* the
 * model answers:
 *
 * - nothing is written, and the operator's own instruction file is unchanged
 *   to the byte;
 * - a soul om-agi never applied here is never reported as `present` on disk;
 * - a pass with no block on disk always carries the caveat that says so — the
 *   attribution guard, which is the whole reason the probes ask for this
 *   soul's own words rather than "who are you";
 * - session-start hooks in this home are reported rather than ignored.
