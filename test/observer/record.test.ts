/**
 * The schema, and the decision that shrank `target`.
 *
 * Two things are worth testing here and the second is the one that matters.
 * The first is ordinary: a line round-trips, a line from another version is
 * refused, a malformed line comes back as a reason rather than an exception.
 *
 * The second is the owner's ruling on what a `target` may hold. The plan for w4
 * proposed a whole command line capped at 512 characters, relying on the
 * pre-commit secret scan to blank out anything dangerous; the owner refused
 * that, on the grounds that a command line is where secrets and personal data
 * most often sit and that the scan's own blind-spot list says it cannot see
 * prose. So the rule is per kind, and these tests are what stop it quietly
 * widening again: each one carries something a full command line would have
 * kept.
 *
 * Every value below is invented (ADR 0001 §4). `/synthetic/...` is not a path
 * on any machine.
