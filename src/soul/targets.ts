/**
 * Where an identity has to land, per backend, on this machine.
 *
 * The registry knows which files each vendor reads; this file turns that into
 * a concrete list of places, resolved against a home and an environment that
 * are both arguments. Nothing here reads `process.env` or `homedir()` on its
 * own — a test that resolved the real home would be a test that plans a write
 * into the operator's live `CLAUDE.md`.
 *
 * Two facts the caller has to be told rather than shielded from:
 *
 * - **Not every backend takes a file.** `ollama` has no instruction file at
 *   any scope; its only channel is the system field of each request. So it is
 *   a target of a different *kind*, not a target that failed. Reporting it as
 *   "nothing to do" would read as a gap, and reporting it as a written file
 *   would be a lie. I-1 means the local backend is a first-class citizen here,
 *   including when the commercial CLIs are not installed at all.
 * - **One file can serve several vendors.** `grok` reads Anthropic's
 *   `CLAUDE.md` as a documented compatibility feature. Writing it once and
 *   naming both readers is the truth; writing it twice would be a bug, and
 *   naming one reader would hide where the identity actually went.
