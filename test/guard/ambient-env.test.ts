/**
 * `src/` is handed its home and its environment; it does not go and look.
 *
 * Two files say so about themselves — `src/state.ts` ("Nothing here reads
 * `process.env` or `homedir()`") and `src/soul/targets.ts` ("are both
 * arguments") — and both sentences are true. What did not exist is the rule
 * those two sentences are examples of, which is why this file is a gate rather
 * than a third comment.
 *
 * **The rule.** Ambient identity and configuration — `homedir()`, `process.env`,
 * `process.cwd()` — are read at the seam where om-agi starts a process or takes
 * a command line, and passed inward as values. Nothing under `src/` reads them
 * for itself, except three files that *are* that seam and are named below with
 * the reason.
 *
 * **Why it is worth a gate and not a habit.** A `src/` file that quietly called
 * `homedir()` would work, and the first thing that noticed would be the test
 * suite: every test here injects a `mkdtemp` home precisely so that nothing runs
 * against the owner's real one (D-021). A function reading ambient `homedir()`
 * cannot be given a fake, so the test that covers it either reads the machine it
 * is running on — writing into a real `~/.claude`, for instance — or is not
 * written at all. The same read also makes the same call return different answers
 * for the same soul on two machines, which is I-3's problem in slow motion.
 *
 * **What this deliberately does not forbid**, with the reason, because a gate
 * whose scope is unstated gets widened by the next person into something that
 * fails honest code:
 *
 * - `process.pid` — a suffix that makes a temp filename unique. It says nothing
 *   about who is running om-agi and cannot differ per identity; four files use it
 *   and all four are writing `x.tmp-<pid>` before a rename.
 * - `process.execPath` — which runtime binary is executing, read once in
 *   `src/guard/hooks.ts` by the impure wrapper around a pure `hookCommand`. It is
 *   the seam shape this gate exists to encourage, not a violation of it.
 * - `bin/` — the seam itself. `bin/shared.ts` reads `homedir()` for `ledgerEnv`,
 *   and every command turns `--home` into a value before calling inward. That is
 *   where this is supposed to happen.
 * - `process["env"]` — not matched here and not needed:
 *   `test/guard/no-push.test.ts` already refuses computed access on `process`
 *   anywhere under `src/` and `bin/`.
