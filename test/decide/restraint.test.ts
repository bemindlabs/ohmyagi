/**
 * The brand that makes "did anything ask the dial?" a question nobody can skip.
 *
 * Three things, the same three `test/observer/capture-notice.test.ts` checks
 * about `CaptureNotice`:
 *
 * 1. `restrain` really does read the decided dial, so the value is not a token
 *    with a number written on it;
 * 2. a turn cannot be composed without one, demonstrated with `@ts-expect-error`
 *    rather than described;
 * 3. **no file outside `src/exec/restraint.ts` says `as Restraint`**, because a
 *    cast would switch the whole mechanism off in one keystroke with nothing in
 *    review to catch the eye.
 *
 * Plus the one thing this brand is for that the other two are not: the vendor
 * with no read-only mechanism is *refused* at level 1, and the refusal quotes
 * the registry's own words rather than paraphrasing them.
