/**
 * odd2 — the free pass, asked of every checker in this repository at once.
 *
 * One question, put to everything that decides a pass: **if the thing it checks
 * were missing entirely, or had never existed, what would it say?** Five real
 * bugs on 2026-09-21 had that shape — `doctor` printing `ok clean · 0 file(s)`
 * from the compiled binary, where `import.meta.dir` resolves inside the
 * executable and the walk read nothing at all.
 *
 * This file is the measured half of `notes/odd2-free-pass-survey.md`. Every row
 * in that report points at a test here, at a row printed by
 * `notes/odd2-driver.ts`, or says in plain words that it was not measured.
 *
 * ## Two shapes, and the difference is deliberate
 *
 * A checker that holds gets an **ordinary assertion**. It stays on as a
 * permanent regression guard, and it goes red the day somebody removes the
 * guard clause that makes it hold.
 *
 * A proven hole got **`test.failing`**, with the assertion written the way the
 * checker *should* behave. The suite therefore stayed green while odd2 fixed
 * nothing, and each of those went red on the day somebody repaired it, which is
 * the one moment a reader needs to be told that a label can come off. The first
 * `describe` below proves `test.failing` really has that behaviour in the bun
 * this suite runs under, rather than assuming it.
 *
 * ## All of them are ordinary tests now, and four are not the tests they were
 *
 * fix1 closed H1 and H2; fix2 closed the rest. Two `test.failing`s remain and
 * they are permanent — they are the controls on the instrument, not holes.
 *
 * The part worth reading before trusting any of this: **four of the seven
 * `test.failing` assertions were wrong about what the repair should be**, and
 * the repair went where the danger was rather than where the probe pointed.
 *
 * - H3 asked for `plan.git === null` over a directory that is no repository.
 *   The dangerous case is the mirror of it — a repository *with* history and a
 *   remote that git refuses to read — and `null` is the value `--no-agent` uses.
 * - H4 asked for `stable: false`. That is the claim that a backend was asked
 *   and wavered, over one that was never asked at all: ADR 0001 §2's `silent`
 *   collapsed into `failed`.
 * - H7 asked for a non-zero exit over an empty index. The reachable way to get
 *   one is a commit that only deletes files, and blocking those teaches people
 *   `--no-verify`. The filter that was really dropping bytes was `ACMR`
 *   swallowing typechanges.
 * - H10 asked for `ok: false` when nothing is written. Writing nothing is the
 *   ordinary result of applying twice, and the only result on a machine whose
 *   one backend is ollama.
 *
 * Each of those rewrites is a moved goalpost unless somebody watched the new
 * assertion fail first. Every one of them was run red against the unrepaired
 * engine before the repair landed, and the reasoning for each rejection is
 * written beside the test rather than carried in a commit message.
 *
 * ## What these probes are not allowed to do
 *
 * No real `HOME`, no vendor CLI, no socket, no push, synthetic fixtures only.
 * Every home here is a `mkdtemp` under `$TMPDIR` and is removed afterwards; the
 * two hosts handed to `doctor` are ports nothing listens on, and the seam is
 * stubbed anyway, so neither is dialled. Nothing here fixes anything.
