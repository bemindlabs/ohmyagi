 * One file, because two readers need the same rule: the usage report (`report.ts`), which refuses a report
 * with any string outside these shapes, and the price table (`src/pricing/table.ts`), whose backend, model
 * and version end up in a signed row. Written twice, the two would drift, and the drift would show up as a
