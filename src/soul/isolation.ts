/**
 * Wear A, switch to B, and prove nothing of A came with it.
 *
 * S1.6 AC2 is the sharpest sentence in the backlog: *สวม A → ถาม → สลับ B →
 * ถามเรื่องที่มีแต่ A รู้ → **B ตอบไม่ได้** (5 ข้อเท็จจริงที่แยกกันชัด)*. Five
 * facts, clearly separate, and the second identity must not be able to produce
 * any of them. This module is the question half of that; `worn.ts` is the disk
 * half, and the test that puts them together is `test/soul/isolation.test.ts`.
 *
 * ## Where the five facts come from
 *
 * From the soul's own `[extra]` table, sorted by key. That table is the one
 * open string table in the schema (`src/soul/schema.ts`) and
 * {@link import("./render.ts").renderSoul} already writes every entry into the
 * applied block under *Also true of this role* — so a fact planted there
 * genuinely travels the channel om-agi controls, rather than being a question
 * about a field the model never saw.
 *
 * Derived rather than written down, for the reason `buildProbes` is derived
 * (D-003): a fact list hard-coded for one soul would measure that soul and pass
 * silently for every other.
 *
 * ## What this proves, and what it does not
 *
 * It proves a claim about the **channel**, which is the thing om-agi owns: after
 * a switch, no text of A reaches the backend, so nothing a backend answers can
 * have come from A through om-agi. It is *not* a claim about a model's memory.
 * A vendor with server-side conversation state, a session-start hook, or a
 * cached context can carry A's words past a file om-agi rewrote, and no file
 * om-agi writes can take those back (I-4). {@link ISOLATION_LIMITS} says that
 * where a reader meets the result.
 *
 * The questions are asked through {@link import("./verify.ts").verifySoul} — the
 * same protocol, scoring and four levels S1.3 uses — so "B could not answer A's
 * questions" and "A could" are readings of one instrument, not two.
