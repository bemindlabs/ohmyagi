/**
 * A backend that can only repeat what the channel carried.
 *
 * S1.6 AC2 says a second identity must not be able to answer the first one's
 * questions. What om-agi owns of that claim is the **channel** — the block in
 * each instruction file, and the system field of a request — and a test that
 * asked a real model would be measuring the model's discretion rather than
 * om-agi's isolation, on a machine where the answer changes with the weather.
 *
 * So this is the most leaky backend that could exist: it reads its whole
 * instruction file (or the whole system field) and hands it back as the answer,
 * with the run's nonce attached. It has no memory, no training and no
 * judgement, which makes it exactly the right instrument for one question:
 *
 * > After the switch, is the first identity's text still reachable at all?
 *
 * A pass here is strong in the direction that matters. It is not "the model
 * declined to say"; it is "everything the channel carried was said, and the
 * other identity's facts were not in it". A failure is equally unambiguous:
 * the text was still there for anything downstream to read.
 *
 * It cannot say anything about what a real model does with a real context, and
 * `test/soul/isolation.real.test.ts` is the opt-in run that looks at that.
