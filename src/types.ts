 * `backend.run({ prompt: flagged })` would compile, and the flag would be
 * decoration on the one call it exists to stop.
 *
 * So this is a box rather than a brand. `Personal<string>` is not a `string`
 * and cannot be passed anywhere a `string` is wanted; the only way to a value
 * is {@link unwrapPersonal}, which is a word a reviewer can search for and an
 * AST gate refuses outside two named files — `src/exec/local.ts`, which is the

 * refuses `as LocalBackend` and `as Personal`, because a cast would turn the
 * check below off in one keystroke with nothing in review to catch the eye.
 *
 * This file is *not* on that list, and the two functions below that read
 * `[CARRIED]` are the reason it does not need to be. {@link unwrapPersonal} is
 * the word the gate permits by name, and {@link countPersonal} is the other way
 * out — a way that cannot carry text at all. See its own comment for what that
 * buys and what it does not.
 *
 * ## What this proves, and what it does not
 *
 * It proves that a `Personal<T>` reaches `ExecBackend.run` only through code
 * that unwrapped it on purpose — `runPersonal` in `src/exec/local.ts` is the
 * one place in the engine that does. It does **not** track the value
 * afterwards: once unwrapped, the string is a string, and no JavaScript type
 * system follows it into a template literal or a `JSON.stringify`. The flag is
 * a gate at one door, not a taint that survives the room.

 * Count what is in the box, and let only the counts out.
 *
 * ## Why this shape, and not a combinator that takes a function
 *
 * The obvious door was `mapPersonal(value, fn)` — compute inside, keep the
 * result boxed — and the owner refused it, for a reason worth keeping next to
 * the code: a combinator that takes a function is a hole with a guard on it.
 * The function decides what comes back, an AST rule can see the call site but
 * not the body, and the closure it is written inside can copy the value to an
 * outer variable without ever saying `unwrapPersonal`. A check that has to be
 * clever is a check somebody will out-clever.
 *
 * So this takes **no function**. The caller supplies two things, both from
 * outside the box:
 *
 * - `tallies` — *data* describing how to compose a key from an item's string
 *   fields: literal words from the caller's own source, plus `field`/`take`
 *   pairs that read one field and may reduce it (`{@link CountTake}`);
 * - `vocabulary` — every key that may appear in the result.
 *
 * The one-sentence proof obligation: **every key in the output came from
 * `vocabulary`, and every value is a count this function did.** A composed key
 * is *looked up* in the vocabulary and never inserted, so no string from inside
 * the box can become a key — not a path, not a project name, not a session id.
 * A `Personal<string[]>` smuggled in yields the vocabulary with zeros, because
 * an item that is not an object has no field to read.
 *
 * ## What this does not prove
 *
 * Nothing here says a count is harmless. An integer is a channel, and whoever
 * writes the tallies chooses what the integers are about — which is a decision
 * in review, not a property of this function. `ACTIONS_LIMITS`
 * (`src/observer/actions.ts`) states that where an owner will read it. What is
 * bounded is the *vocabulary of keys* and the *type of values*, and that is
 * bounded by construction rather than by filtering.
