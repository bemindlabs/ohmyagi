/**
 * One synthetic agent, and data of its subject in every kind of place the data
 * map names — so a deploy plan has something real to measure.
 *
 * Built on `synthetic-soul.ts`'s identity A (D-021: every fixture is synthetic).
 * The repository's `.git/` is written by hand — a HEAD, a ref, nothing else —
 * because `deploy plan` reads exactly those two files to decide whether there
 * is a commit to clone, and a test of *that* must not depend on a `git` binary
 * being on the machine running it. Tests that need a real commit make one.
 *
 * Every byte lands under the directory the caller passes, which is always a
 * `mkdtemp` in a test.
