/**
 * S7.2 AC4 for the observer — "แจ้งก่อน" enforced by a type rather than by a
 * habit.
 *
 * AC4 says the things that cannot be deleted must be disclosed *before*, not
 * discovered when somebody asks to delete. For raw capture, "before" means
 * before the directory that holds the records exists — and the only way to make
 * that a property of the program rather than a convention w4 has to remember is
 * to make the disclosure a **value** `ensureObserverDir` requires.
 *
 * So `announceCapture(write)` is the one constructor of `CaptureNotice`, and
 * three things are checked here:
 *
 * 1. calling it really writes `OBSERVER_UNDELETABLE` somewhere;
 * 2. `ensureObserverDir` without one does not compile, demonstrated with
 *    `@ts-expect-error` rather than described;
 * 3. no file outside `src/observer/store.ts` says `as CaptureNotice`, because
 *    a cast would turn the whole mechanism off in one keystroke with nothing in
 *    review to catch the eye — the same gate `test/guard/personal-type.test.ts`
 *    puts around `Personal<T>`.
 *
 * **What it does not prove, and the code says so too:** that anybody read the
 * lines. A type can witness a call; no type can witness a reading. That limit
 * is in `OBSERVER_LIMITS`, asserted at the bottom, so deleting it breaks a test
 * rather than quietly widening the claim.
