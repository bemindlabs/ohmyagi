/**
 * D-156 — the owner's answer to one held action, from the two places an owner answers: a terminal
 * (`task approve|deny`) and the web page (behind its key). Never from a turn.
 *
 * ## What keeps a turn from answering (reviews of PR #24)
 *
 * The owner's turns run as the owner's uid, and a turn at write/run 2 has a shell. What it could use, and what
 * stops it:
 *
 * 1. **The release itself.** Ed25519 (round 3): the runner makes the pair when the task's browser starts, after
 *    making itself not dumpable (so `/proc/<pid>/mem` is closed even to the turn that started it; it refuses to
 *    start under a turn at all), and keeps the private key in its memory only. The container gets the public
 *    key and verifies with it. The runner alone writes releases (`writeReleases`).
 * 2. **A claim written directly** in the task's store. The runner checks a yes again before it signs it: one
 *    claimed while any turn of the owner's that can run commands ran — of any agent — is tainted
 *    ({@link taintedAt}, and the runner's own memory of every such turn it saw, `taint-watch.ts`, which a turn
 *    deleting or flipping its run record cannot erase) and released as a no; a yes for a step that is not
 *    running, or a task that has ended, is released as a no.
 * 3. **`task approve` at a fake terminal** (`script`). All three streams must be terminals, and no process above
 *    may be a recorded turn or a task's runner ({@link agentAncestor}, walking `/proc` parent ids).
 * 4. **The web page's key.** While any loosened turn of the owner runs, no answer is taken from the page or the
 *    terminal ({@link loosenedTurn}); and a loosened turn does not start while any held action waits.
 *
 * **What is left, exactly (Q4, the owner's decision):** any process of the owner's user can bypass holds. That
 * includes a process left running after every loosened turn has ended (by the page's key, or a claim the runner
 * then signs), and — the larger door — **a running loosened turn through the docker socket**: the owner is in
 * the `docker` group, so such a turn can `docker exec -u 0` into the task's container and drive Chromium
 * directly, past `record.cjs` altogether. That is root-equivalent and outside this code; nothing here tries to
 * engineer around it. Closing it needs Q4: a separate user for the runner and its store, or a passkey for each
 * yes **and** no docker group for the user turns run as. Until then this is D-042's limit (anything running as
 * the owner's uid can do what the owner's uid can).
 *
 * **How the page is read (D-160), and what is left of it.** Nothing about an element is read in the page's own
 * JavaScript any more (last review round): where keys go, what is at a point, whether an element is a text
 * field or a password field, and whether a password field anywhere holds something are read through CDP in an
 * isolated world (`docker/browser/cdp-read.cjs`) — through every shadow root, closed and declarative included,
 * and every frame — so a page that redefines `tagName`, `isContentEditable`, `getAttribute`, `value` or
 * `shadowRoot` changes nothing. A shadow host is never a text field. What cannot be read — no CDP, an error, a
 * frame of another process that keys would go to — is held. Keys that would land anywhere but a text field ask.
 * What is left:
 * - A page can copy what the model typed into an ordinary field into a password field (or send it as one) at
 *   submit time, in its own script.
 * - A page can keylog an ordinary text field. D-160 classifies by the field a key lands in, not by what the
 *   page's own script does with it.
 * - And Q4 above: anything running as the owner's user — the docker socket included — can bypass the holds.
