/**
 * AC3 — "ตรวจซ้ำ: ค้นตัวระบุของ subject ทั้งระบบได้ 0 ผลลัพธ์", with "ทั้งระบบ"
 * given a definition that is printed rather than assumed.
 *
 * A criterion that says *the whole system* and a program that searches four
 * directories are not the same claim, and the gap between them is where a
 * verification stops being evidence. So this file exports both halves:
 * {@link SEARCHED}, which is what a run really reads, and {@link NOT_SEARCHED},
 * which is what it cannot and does not — printed on every run, including the
 * ones that find nothing.
 *
 * ## How a hit is decided
 *
 * Bytes, not parsing. A half-written JSONL record, a file that is not valid
 * UTF-8 and a Markdown document are all the same thing to this: a sequence of
 * bytes that either contains the needle or does not. Anything schema-aware
 * would stop finding things on the day a schema changed, which is the failure
 * mode `census` avoids for the same reason.
 *
 * A subject id is matched on **subject-alphabet boundaries**: the id `demo` is
 * a hit in `subject = "demo"` and not in `demonstration`, because the alphabet
 * a `SubjectId` may use is `[a-z0-9_-]` and a character from it on either side
 * means the match is part of a longer word. Directory and file *names* equal to
 * the id count as hits too — a tree called `.../demo/` holds the identifier in
 * its path whether or not any byte inside it does.
 *
 * Everything else — a soul's display name, a `--needle` somebody passed — is a
 * plain substring search, and **that is coarse on purpose**. Thai has no word
 * boundary: a needle like `หนู` will match inside longer words and report more
 * than it should. Over-reporting is the safe direction for a deletion check, but
 * it is not precision, and {@link SEARCH_LIMITS} says so in the output so that
 * a reader knows what a number means before acting on it.
 *
 * ## What is never in the result
 *
 * The needle text for a `--needle` is counted and never echoed. A verification
 * report that printed the secret somebody asked to have deleted would have put
 * it in terminal scrollback, in whatever the output was piped to, and possibly
 * in the certificate file — none of which any erase can reach. The same rule
 * `guard scan` already follows.
