/**
 * Where what the owner actually did is kept, and how all of it goes away.
 *
 * ## The address (AC1), and why it moved
 *
 * D-014 sketched observer data under `.dagi/observer/`, on the understanding
 * that E3 would mine it back out of vendor transcripts whenever it was needed.
 * SP-1 measured those transcripts and D-024 changed the epic: claude keeps
 * seven weeks and grok keeps eleven days, so E3 captures **at the moment
 * something happens** and the capture is the only copy there will ever be.
 *
 * That makes the old address wrong, for the same reason ADR 0002 §3 gives for
 * the ledger: `.dagi/` holds only what a derivation register can rebuild, and a
 * rebuild *sweeps out* everything else. This is not a theory —
 * `test/agent/rebuild.test.ts` has asserted since S0.3 that a rebuild deletes
 * `.dagi/observer/raw.jsonl` and names it while doing so. Capture into that
 * directory would have been a feature whose data the next `ohmyagi rebuild`
 * silently removed.
 *
 * Git is not the answer either. A record of what a person did, minute by
 * minute, is the most withdrawable thing om-agi will ever hold (I-4), and git
 * remembers what it is asked to forget.
 *
 * So, proposed as **D-025** and decided by the owner before this file was
 * written: **raw capture is personal by default**, and it lives at exactly one
 * address —
 *
 *     $XDG_DATA_HOME/om-agi/<subject>/personal/observer/
 *
 * which is {@link observerDir}, built on `personalDir` (S0.4) rather than
 * beside it. Three properties come with that and none of them is re-implemented
 * here: the path is refused outright if it resolves inside a git repository,
 * the pre-commit scan blocks anything staged under a `personal/` directory, and
 * the tree is created 0700.
 *
 * The intended consequence: everything that reads observer data is reading
 * something flagged personal, so it is on the far side of `Personal<T>` and
 * `runPersonal` (`src/exec/local.ts`) — which is what S3.2 AC4 was waiting for
 * when it said "or wait for a local model after S3.5".
 *
 * ## No network, and nothing that could become one (AC2)
 *
 * Nothing under `src/observer/` may import `src/spawn.ts` or anything in
 * `src/exec/`. A subprocess is a network stack with extra steps, so the rule
 * that keeps this path local is "it cannot start one", not "it does not call
 * fetch". Getting there cost one refactor: `enclosingGitRepo` used to live in
 * `src/agent/new.ts`, which runs `git init`, so merely asking "is this inside
 * git?" pulled the chokepoint into the closure. It is `src/agent/repo.ts` now.
 *
 * `test/observer/no-network.test.ts` and `test/observer/no-socket.test.ts`
 * check that three ways — AST over the closure, traps inside the process, and
 * `strace` over the real CLI — each with a control that proves the check bites.
 *
 * ## Counting rather than parsing (AC3)
 *
 * {@link census} counts files, lines and bytes and never parses a record. That
 * is deliberate: w4 owns the capture schema and has not written it yet, and a
 * purge that understood the schema would be a purge that stopped working — and
 * stopped deleting — on the day the schema changed. Bytes are bytes.
