/**
 * The compiled binary, asserted against — because nothing else here is.
 *
 * Every other test in this repository runs from the checkout, and a whole class
 * of fault is invisible from there: `import.meta.dir` resolves to a real
 * directory in a checkout and to a path inside the executable under
 * `bun build --compile`. `doctor` used to walk that path, read nothing, find
 * nothing, and print `ok clean · 0 file(s)`. Three green gates and a parity
 * harness all agreed, and the owner found it by running the binary once.
 *
 * The binary is also what `scripts/demo-bare-container.sh` ships and what
 * anyone else would be handed, so "it works from source" is not the claim worth
 * defending.
 *
 * **Not gated behind an environment variable.** The opt-in tests here exist
 * because they spend vendor quota or touch something real; a build spends
 * neither, and a test nobody runs by default is the same hole this file closes.
