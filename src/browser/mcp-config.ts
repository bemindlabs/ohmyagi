/**
 * D-155 — the one MCP server every CLI is handed: the task's Playwright MCP,
 * reached on a loopback port, through a configuration om-agi writes itself.
 *
 * The owner's own MCP servers stay off (D-047's intent), so a vendor is wired
 * only where om-agi can say *only this server*. What each vendor offers was
 * measured on this machine on 2026-10-05 — `--help` first, then the vendor's
 * own listing command where it has one (no model was called for those):
 *
 * | vendor | version | how a server is given | can the owner's be kept out? | here |
 * |---|---|---|---|---|
 * | claude, claude-local | 2.1.289 | `--mcp-config <configs...>` (JSON files or strings) | yes: `--strict-mcp-config` — *"Only use MCP servers from --mcp-config, ignoring all other MCP configurations"*, already on every turn (D-047) | wired |
 * | grok-local | 1.0.46 | no flag; `[mcp_servers.<name>] url = …` in `$GROK_HOME/config.toml`, a home om-agi owns for this backend | yes (the home is om-agi's; D-119 already switches off what grok borrows from Claude/Cursor) | **refused**: see below |
 * | grok | 1.0.46 | the same file, in the owner's `~/.grok` (it holds the login) | no — the only home with a login is the owner's | refused |
 * | kimi | 2.1.1 | no flag; `mcp.json` in `$KIMI_CODE_HOME` (the login's home), merged with a project `.mcp.json` and `<cwd>/.kimi-code/mcp.json` | no strict switch: project files in the working directory are always merged | refused |
 * | codex | 0.155.1 | `-c mcp_servers.<name>.url="…"` per run | no: `-c` *adds* to the owner's `[mcp_servers]` (measured: an owner's server stayed `enabled` beside ours, also with `-c mcp_servers={…}`); and codex cannot act on this machine at all (bwrap, D-121) | refused |
 * | gemini, copilot, ollama | — | not measured / no tools | — | refused |
 *
 * grok-local, measured with a real turn on `local-coder` (2026-10-05): grok
 * puts MCP tools behind its meta-tools `search_tool` and `use_tool` — the model
 * saw "25 tools" on the server and no tool names. D-119 removes those two at
 * every level, because a level-1 turn used `use_tool` to reach a shell, so
 * with D-119 in force grok has no way to call the browser (it fell back to
 * other tools and never touched the container). Giving them back is a product
 * decision about D-119, not a wiring detail, so grok-local stays refused here.
