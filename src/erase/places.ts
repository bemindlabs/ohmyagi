/**
 * The five places S7.2 AC1 names, and the four of them that exist.
 *
 * AC1 reads *ลบครบ 5 ที่: soul · observer data · RAG collection · ledger · LoRA
 * adapter*. One of those five has no code in this repository at all: there is
 * no adapter (S6.3). The vector store arrived with S4.1 (D-038) and brought its
 * deleter in the same commit. A command that printed "5 of 5 deleted" would
 * therefore be making the exact claim I-4's second half forbids — *do not say
 * you deleted what you cannot delete* — about the place whose data is the
 * hardest to get back.
 *
 * So this file is a **closed registry with two statuses in it**, and the
 * string `5` never appears next to the word "deleted". Output and certificate
 * say `4 of 4 places that exist · 1 of 5 are not built`.
 *
 * Three properties are worth naming, because each one is a way this could have
 * gone quietly wrong:
 *
 * - **Closed at the type level.** `PLACES satisfies Record<PlaceId, Place>`, so
 *   a missing place and a sixth one are both `tsc` errors rather than a line
 *   nobody notices is gone.
 * - **`not-built` carries its debt.** The story that owes it, the address D-014
 *   reserves for it, and the five things it must bring when it registers. An
 *   erase run looks at that address: **something there with no deleter for it
 *   is an exit 1 and no certificate**, because the alternative is certifying a
 *   deletion over a directory nobody claimed.
 * - **The debt has a test, not a comment.** `test/erase/places.test.ts` fails
 *   if a derivation starts writing under the reserved address, or if anything
 *   in `src/` names an adapter path while `lora` still says `not-built`. The
 *   same test held `rag` to that until S4.1 paid it: the socket in the erase
 *   layer is one file (`src/memory/store-admin.ts`) that can `GET` and `DELETE`
 *   a collection by name and cannot send a body.
 *
 * ## The lists, by reference
 *
 * Every place carries the "what deletion cannot reach" lists it is responsible
 * for, and they are the **same array objects** that `ledger forget`,
 * `observe purge` and `guard status` already print — never copies. ADR 0002's
 * "when erase lands it must print this same list rather than a second copy of
 * it" is kept by `toBe`, which a copy would fail.
 *
 * The one new list is {@link WEIGHTS_UNDELETABLE}, owned by `lora`, because no
 * existing list says what a trained weight keeps: there was nothing to reuse.
