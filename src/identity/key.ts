/**
 * The agent's own ed25519 keypair on disk (S15.8, D-108, D-138): made once, read many times, never shown.
 *
 * One file, `$XDG_DATA_HOME/om-agi/<subject>/identity/ed25519.pem` — the private key as PKCS#8 PEM, from which
 * the public half is derived whenever it is needed, so the two can never disagree. Mode 600 in a directory of
 * mode 700, outside every git repository, and refused otherwise:
 *
 * - **Made once.** {@link ensureAgentKey} writes only where nothing is, and a second call reads what the first
 *   wrote. Nothing here overwrites a key, because a replaced key is a different agent to everyone who knew the
 *   old one — replacing it is a decision for a person with `rm`, not a side effect.
 * - **Written whole or not at all.** The key is written to a new file beside the final name (`wx`, 600, named
 *   for this process), flushed, and then *linked* to the final name. `link` fails if the name exists, so two
 *   processes racing to make a key end with one key, and a crash leaves either no key or a whole one — never
 *   half a PEM under the real name. What a crash can leave is the temporary file; the next `ensureAgentKey`
 *   removes any whose process is gone.
 * - **Read through one open file.** The key is opened with `O_NOFOLLOW` (a symlink is refused by the kernel,
 *   not by an earlier `lstat` that could be raced) and `O_NONBLOCK` (a FIFO put there cannot hang the read),
 *   and every check — a regular file, this user's, no bits for group or others, at most 4 KiB — is made on
 *   *that handle* with `fstat`, and the bytes are read from it (S15.8 security review, L8).
 * - **Refused when anyone else could read it**, or could have swapped it: a key that group or others can read
 *   may already be somebody else's, so signing with it would put the agent's name on whatever they sign. The
 *   same rule `ohmyagi web --key-file` keeps (D-069), with the `chmod` that fixes it in the reason. Above the
 *   file, OpenSSH's StrictModes: `identity/` must be this user's and 700, and `<subject>/` and the data root
 *   `om-agi/` above it this user's (or root's) and not writable by group or others — a directory someone else
 *   can write to is one they can put their own key in.
 * - **Never shown.** Nothing returns the private key: an {@link AgentKey} carries the public half and a `sign`
 *   function that closes over the private one, so no property, `JSON.stringify` or log line can reach it.
 *
 * What this cannot stop: a program running as the owner's uid can read the file, as it can read every other
 * secret om-agi keeps (the page key, the A2A tokens). A separate uid is outside om-agi.
