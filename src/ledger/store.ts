/**
 * The ledger on disk: append, read back, and — the hard half — delete.
 *
 * Plain files and nothing else. No sqlite, no daemon, no index: an owner with
 * `cat` and `jq` can read every byte om-agi wrote about them without om-agi
 * installed, and an owner with `rm` can end it. That is not minimalism for its
 * own sake; it is what makes the deletion promise in I-4 checkable by someone
 * who does not trust this code.
 *
 * Where: `$XDG_STATE_HOME/om-agi/ledger/<subject>/YYYY-MM.jsonl`.
 *
 * ADR 0002 §3 originally said `om-agi/<subject>/`, and that is a bug rather
 * than a preference: `backups` is a valid subject id, so a subject called
 * `backups` would have landed on top of the tree `soul apply` keeps originals
 * in. The extra `ledger/` segment puts the two side by side instead, and the
 * ADR has been corrected to match.
 *
 * Why one file per month: a time-ranged query reads only the months it needs,
 * and — more to the point — a `forget` rewrites only the months it touched,
 * so the blast radius of the one operation that is not append-only stays as
 * small as the request that caused it.
 *
 * ## Append-only (AC2), and deletion (I-4), in the same file
 *
 * These do not contradict each other. The *writing* path has exactly one
 * operation: a single `O_APPEND` write of a whole line. There is no update, no
 * upsert, and no API anywhere in om-agi that edits a line in place. Deletion
 * is a separate command the owner types, and it does not edit lines either —
 * it filters a file and replaces it.
 *
 * ## The lock, and why it is not optional
 *
 * `mkdir` is the lock, because it is the one filesystem operation that is
 * atomic on every filesystem worth supporting. Both append and forget take it.
 * Without it, a turn that finished during a `forget`'s rename would append to
 * a file that is about to be replaced, and the line would vanish — silently,
 * which is the failure mode this project is built to refuse. A lock that is
 * already held is reported with its path; om-agi does not guess that a lock is
 * stale, because the cost of guessing wrong is a lost record.
