/**
 * Reading the index rather than the working tree — the difference a scanner
 * that got it wrong would never notice.
 *
 * `git add secret.md && $EDITOR secret.md` leaves a clean file on disk and a
 * dirty blob in the index, and a commit keeps the blob. Every test here is a
 * variation on that: the bytes this module returns have to be the bytes the
 * commit would carry, not the ones somebody can see.
 *
 * The other case with teeth is the first commit, where there is no HEAD to
 * diff against. Getting that wrong means the guard never runs on the one
 * commit that lays down everything a repository starts with.
