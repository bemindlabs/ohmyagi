/**
 * One line of the ledger: what it says, and the longer list of what it does not.
 *
 * The ledger is the most sensitive thing om-agi writes. A soul is a claim about
 * an identity and can be read by anyone the owner shows it to; a ledger is the
 * actual conversation, and by S8.2 and S9.1 it will hold messages sent to other
 * people. So the shape below is chosen by subtraction — the question asked of
 * every candidate field was not "is this useful?" but "would losing control of
 * this line matter more with it than without it?".
 *
 * **One line per prompt that really reached a backend**, not per turn. A chain
 * where `claude` is silent and `ollama` answers writes two lines under one
 * `turn` id, because the fact S2.2 exists to record — and the fact I-6 turns on
 * — is *who received this text*, and two backends did. A backend reported
 * `unavailable` never received it and gets no line.
 *
 * What is deliberately absent, and why:
 *
 * - **The soul text.** Already in git, where the owner can read it. A second
 *   copy out here is a second copy to find and delete. `soul_sha` says which
 *   version was worn, which is the only part a later reader needs.
 * - **`evidence.raw`.** A vendor's raw stdout/stderr carries account emails,
 *   session ids, absolute paths and occasionally a token in an error message —
 *   and duplicates `text` when the turn worked at all.
 * - **`env` and `cwd`.** One may hold secrets; the other is a path on this
 *   machine, which D-021 keeps out of anything om-agi writes on its own.
 * - **hostname, username, absolute paths.** Same reason, and none of them are
 *   needed to answer "what did this agent do?".
 *
 * And what is **not** filtered: the prompt is stored exactly as it was typed.
 * om-agi does not scan it for secrets and does not promise to. The honest tool
 * for a prompt that must not be kept is `--private`, which does not write it in
 * the first place — see {@link LedgerContent}.
 *
 * Field names are `snake_case` while the rest of the codebase is `camelCase`.
 * That is on purpose: this is a wire format an owner is expected to read with
 * `jq` and nothing else (AC5, as amended), so it follows the conventions of
 * JSON on disk rather than of the program that happens to write it.
