/**
 * Run records, and the rule that a kill switch may never guess.
 *
 * ## How this file signals, and why it is written this way
 *
 * Testing a thing that kills processes has an obvious way to go wrong, so every
 * case that sends a signal obeys three rules without exception:
 *
 * 1. **Every target is a process this file started**, through `Bun.spawn`, kept
 *    in {@link started} and killed in `afterEach` whatever happened.
 * 2. **Every target is checked to be a child of this test** — `procStat(pid).ppid
 *    === process.pid` — immediately before the signal, by {@link mine}. A pid
 *    that is not ours fails the test rather than being signalled.
 * 3. **Nothing is ever sent to a negative pid by this file.** `terminateRun`
 *    decides that for itself, and what it decided is read back out of the
 *    report rather than assumed.
 *
 * ## D-028 — nothing here asserts anything that depends on the machine
 *
 * There is no assertion about how long anything took. Waiting is a bounded poll
 * with a small sleep, and the bound exists to catch a structural break (a signal
 * that never goes at all), not a busy machine. Where a number was measured it is
 * **printed with the load average** rather than asserted, in the words
 * `test/scripts/cli-parity.test.ts` settled on.
