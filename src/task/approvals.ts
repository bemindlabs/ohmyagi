/**
 * D-156 — the approval channel: a sensitive browser action a task's container is holding, asked of the owner,
 * answered once.
 *
 * ## The way through
 *
 * 1. The container (`docker/browser/record.cjs`, `release.cjs`) holds an action D-153's list flags and writes it
 *    to `<recording>/pending/<id>.json`: the step's kind, element role and text, origin, the rules that held it,
 *    its digest, when it was filed and when the wait ends. No typed value is in it, ever.
 * 2. The task's runner sees it while the step runs ({@link watchApprovals}), files it in the task's own store
 *    (`approvals/<id>.json`, copied — the recording is the browser's, the store is the task's) and the task is
 *    `waiting`. Every channel shows it: `task show`, `/api/state`, `/api/tasks/<id>`, the page and the app.
 * 3. The owner answers ({@link decideApproval}): `task approve|deny`, or `POST /api/tasks/<id>/approvals/<id>/…`.
 *    The answer is **claimed** first — `approvals/decided/<id>.json`, linked into place (D-144's exclusive step):
 *    of two answers sent at once exactly one is the answer, and an approval is never decided twice. Only then is
 *    the release written into the recording, signed with the task's release key.
 * 4. The container takes the release only for that id, with the digest it computed itself and a valid mac, and
 *    once (`release.cjs`); the action goes ahead or is refused, and the model is told which. The task is
 *    `running` again; a no is said to the next step too.
 *
 * ## Expiry
 *
 * No answer by `expiresAt` is a no: the container stops waiting a few seconds after it (grace for a yes sent
 * just in time), and here an answer after `expiresAt` is refused. The runner claims the expiry, so a late
 * answer finds the approval decided.
 *
 * ## The digest
 *
 * Recomputed here from the action the pending file describes — the same canonical bytes as `release.cjs`
 * (`test/task/approvals.test.ts` holds the two equal) — and a pending file whose digest does not match is not
 * offered. The container compares against the digest it computed when it held the action, not the file's.
