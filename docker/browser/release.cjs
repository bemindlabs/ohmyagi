// D-156 — a held action waits for the owner's answer instead of being refused outright.
//
// When D-153's list holds an action (record.cjs) and the container was started for a task that can ask
// (`OM_AGI_APPROVAL_WAIT` > 0 and a release public key), the action is not refused: it is written to
// /out/pending/<id>.json — what kind of step, on which element, on which origin, which rules held it; never a
// typed value — and the click, keystroke or dialog answer waits there. om-agi (the task's runner on the host)
// files it as a pending approval the web page, the app and `ohmyagi task approve|deny` show.
//
// The answer comes back as /out/release/<id>.json, written by om-agi on the host:
//   { id, digest, verdict: "approve" | "deny", sig }
// It is taken only when
// - its id is this action's, and its digest is the digest *this process* computed of the action when it held
//   it (not the digest in the pending file, which is only a copy) — so a yes is bound to exactly that step;
// - its sig is an Ed25519 signature over the id, the digest and the verdict that verifies with the task's
//   release **public** key (review of PR #24, round 3). The private key never leaves the task's runner — a
//   process that is not dumpable — so nothing in this container, and nothing that can read this container's
//   files from the host, holds anything that could sign: a file that was not signed by the runner is not an
//   answer;
// - it arrives before the wait ends (`expiresAt`, and a few seconds' grace for a yes written just in time).
// It is renamed to <id>.used before anything is done with it, and this process waits on each id once: one
// approval releases one action, once. No answer in time is a no.
//
// D-160 (the owner, 2026-10-05): a credential — typing into a password field, submitting a form that holds
// one, answering a password-like prompt — is never released, and the owner cannot approve one, until a store
// exists that fills values without the model seeing them. Such an action is written to /out/pending with
// `approvable: false`, so every channel shows it ("not allowed yet"), and refused at once: no wait.
//
// Pure apart from the file and clock functions it is handed, so test/task/approvals.test.ts runs it in Bun.
