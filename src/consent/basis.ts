/**
 * S7.3 — on what basis a subject's data came in, and for what use (D-077).
 *
 * Before anything of a subject is read into an agent — notes into memory,
 * artifacts into a persona draft — there must be a record of the basis for it:
 * which basis, who approved it, when, for which uses, until when (AC1). No
 * record, or one that has expired, been revoked, or does not name the use, and
 * the command stops before it reads a file (AC2, AC3). The owner's own data
 * goes through the same record with the basis `owner` — no shortcut (AC4).
 *
 * The record says what someone decided; it cannot say the decision was
 * lawful. That is the approver's, and the record names them so it is clear
 * whose it was.
