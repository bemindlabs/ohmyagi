 * copies of it that had already drifted apart: one built a directory holding a
 * single symlink to `bun`, the other handed the child the directory `bun`
 * itself lives in — which is where `bun add -g` installs global packages, so
 * `bun add -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` would have made "off PATH" quietly
 * false and the test would have gone on passing.
 *
 * So the PATH is built here, and the claim about it is *asserted* here, for
 * every vendor in the registry rather than the two anybody happened to think
 * of. A precondition that is not checked is not a precondition; it is a hope.
