/**
 * S8.4 — who this agent may talk to (D-063).
 *
 * An allowlist, never a denylist: a peer that is not on it is refused both
 * ways. A peer is added only by a person typing a phrase at a terminal — the
 * same shape as level 3 (D-042) — so an agent acting on its own cannot widen
 * its own reach (AC2, D-015, I-6). What a vendor CLI running as the owner's
 * uid could still do is write this file directly; the same caveat as the
 * level-3 record, and the same answer: a separate uid is outside om-agi.
 *
 * Each peer carries a token *we* issue. A peer calling in presents it as a
 * bearer; that is how an inbound message is tied to a peer at all, because
 * A2A's P1 exchange carries no identity of its own. A peer's own token for
 * calling *it* is optional and kept beside it.
