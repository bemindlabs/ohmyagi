/**
 * Where personal data goes (AC4), and the two ways that could go wrong.
 *
 * **Inside a repository.** `XDG_DATA_HOME` is a variable and a variable can
 * point anywhere, including into a checkout somebody keeps their notes in.
 * The resolver refuses rather than writing there, because the whole point of
 * AC4 is that this data is never in version control — not ignored, not
 * untracked, not there.
 *
 * **Under the wrong identity.** The subject is an argument and is never
 * inferred from a directory name (I-3). Two subjects get two directories, and
 * nothing about the agent's folder decides which is which.
