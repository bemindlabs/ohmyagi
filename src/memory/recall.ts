/**
 * Build an agent's recall, and ask it something (S4.1, D-037).
 *
 * Two indexes over one source. The full-text file is local and always built;
 * the vector collection needs two servers and may not be (S4.1 AC4, I-1):
 * {@link indexAgent} reports which halves it built rather than failing the
 * whole run, and {@link recall} searches whichever halves answer.
 *
 * Results are merged by reciprocal rank fusion — each hit scores
 * `1 / (RRF_K + rank)` in every list it appears in, and the sums are sorted.
 * RRF needs no calibration between bm25 (lower is better, unbounded) and
 * cosine (higher is better, in [-1, 1]); it reads only positions.
