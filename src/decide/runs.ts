/**
 * Run records — the thing that makes a kill switch possible at all, and the
 * thing that makes the manual command possible when it is not.
 *
 * Before this file, a turn that was killed mid-flight left **nothing**: the
 * ledger is written after the vendor answers (`src/ledger/recording.ts`), and
 * nothing anywhere recorded that a turn had started. A process that died between
 * those two moments was invisible afterwards, and there was no number anybody
 * could have typed to stop it.
 *
 * ## `pid_start` is the whole of the safety
 *
 * A pid is reused. A record saying "pid 4812 is a turn" is, some hours later, a
 * record saying "kill whatever is now 4812", and what is now 4812 might be
 * anything at all. So every record also stores field 22 of `/proc/<pid>/stat` —
 * the process's start time in clock ticks since boot — and a record whose pid
 * exists with a *different* start time is classified `stale` and **never
 * signalled**.
 *
 * This is not the guess `src/ledger/store.ts` refuses to make about a lock
 * (*"om-agi does not guess that a lock is stale"*). A start time is a fact that
 * can be compared: either the process running under that number is the one the
 * record was written about, or it is not. A machine with no `/proc` cannot do
 * the comparison, and there the answer is to refuse to signal and print the
 * manual command instead — never to signal on a pid alone.
 *
 * ## Why the vendor child is spawned detached, and what it cost
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-22 on this runtime, over nine invocation shapes, and the
 * answer is **split** — which is worth saying plainly, because the one-line
 * version ("om-agi's process group belongs to the shell") is true of some
 * shapes and false of the one a person is most likely to be in:
 *
 * - **With a controlling terminal, a foreground job gets a group of its own.**
 *   Measured: `pgid` equal to its own pid, one member, om-agi. So for somebody
 *   typing `ohmyagi turn …` at a shell, the collision this file guards against
 *   **does not happen** and `detached` buys nothing at all.
 * - **Without one, every shape measured shared the caller's group.** A
 *   non-interactive `bash -c`, the same piped, `bash -ic` with no tty, a direct
 *   spawn with no shell between, and `npm exec` all came back with 5 to 7
 *   members of which exactly one was om-agi — the rest being the invoking
 *   harness, `npm`, `sh` and the shell. Printing that number under the words
 *   `kill -TERM -<pgid>` would hand somebody a command that kills their own
 *   session. These are also the shapes an unattended agent runs under, which is
 *   the case a kill switch exists for.
 * - **A pipeline puts a stranger in the group even with a terminal.** Measured:
 *   `om-agi … | cat` at an interactive shell makes om-agi the group *leader*
 *   with `cat` in the group beside it. Leading a group is therefore **not**
 *   proof that the group holds nothing but a process and its descendants — see
 *   {@link strangersInGroup}, which checks rather than assumes it.
 * - `Bun.spawn(..., { detached: true })` gives the child a group of its own with
 *   itself as leader, which makes `kill -TERM -<pgid>` exact.
 *
 * What it costs: a detached child no longer receives the terminal's Ctrl-C, so
 * om-agi has to pass a signal on itself, which is machinery that can break at the
 * same moment everything else does. That cost is acceptable for one measured
 * reason — Ctrl-C **was never reliable here anyway**. A grandchild started as a
 * shell background job ignores SIGINT by POSIX default and survived a group
 * SIGINT in measurement; the same process died on a group SIGTERM. The thing
 * being protected by staying attached does not work.
 *
 * ## Nothing in this file signals anything it has not identified first
 *
 * {@link terminateRun} sends to a *group* only when the target process leads
 * that group **and every other member of it descends from the target** — both
 * halves, because the measurement above found a shape where the first holds and
 * the second does not. A process that fails either test gets a signal addressed
 * to it alone, and is told so in the report. There is no path here that sends
 * to a negative pid taken on trust.
