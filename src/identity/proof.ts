/**
 * Proof that whoever registers a public key on a market holds its private half (S15.4 step one, D-141).
 *
 * A market that takes a public key on the owner's word can be handed somebody else's — copied off that agent's
 * card — and would then credit that agent's signed reports to the wrong listing (platform PR #6 review, M1). So
 * the market asks for a proof: it issues a one-time nonce for one account and one listing, and the agent signs
 * a payload naming the market, the listing and that nonce with the key being registered.
 *
 * ## The payload
 *
 * `{kind: "ohmyagi.key-proof", v: 1, market, listing, nonce, at}` — signed exactly as a usage report is, in
 * the S15.8 envelope (`sign.ts`: Ed25519 over the RFC 8785 canonical JSON, integers only):
 *
 * | field | value |
 * |---|---|
 * | `market` | the market's origin, `scheme://host[:port]` — `marketOriginProblem` in `shapes.ts` |
 * | `listing` | the listing's slug, the platform's own rule — `isListingSlug` |
 * | `nonce` | the challenge: 32 bytes, base64url without padding, 43 characters, one spelling |
 * | `at` | when it was signed, an ISO-8601 UTC instant; for a person, not a freshness check |
 *
 * Each field closes one way the proof could be used somewhere it was not meant for: `kind` keeps it from being
 * read as any other signed thing, `market` from being replayed at another market, `listing` at another listing
 * on this one, and `nonce` — issued once, expiring in ten minutes, spent in the same transaction that registers
 * the key — from being replayed at all. Freshness is the nonce's job, on the market's clock; `at` only says
 * when this machine signed it.
 *
 * ## Checking one
 *
 * {@link verifyKeyProof} is what the platform does (D-141 §1): strict JSON (no duplicate names, integers in one
 * spelling), the envelope signed by exactly the key expected, `kind` and `v` exactly, every field in its
 * shape, and `market`, `listing` and `nonce` each exactly the one expected. It never throws.
 *
 * The test vector the platform ports is `test/fixtures/key-proof-v1.json`, signed with RFC 8032's test-1 key.
