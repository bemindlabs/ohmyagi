/**
 * What the chat's backend and model picker offers (D-085, D-142).
 *
 * Only names that have a reason to work, and only from the vendor's side: the
 * names a vendor CLI documents for its own model flag (`ModelSpec.listed`, read
 * off its `--help`), the names a price table in force lists for that backend,
 * the local model this page was started with, and what the local Ollama lists.
 *
 * Not the ledger. It used to be: models that had answered on a backend, newest
 * first. But a line's `model` was not always a model the backend was handed — a
 * claude line from before S15.9 says `qwen3:8b` — and a stale name offered as a
 * suggestion is a turn that fails. A backend that takes no model (the local CLI
 * variants run `local-coder` and nothing else) is offered none. The box stays
 * free text, so any other name can still be typed.
