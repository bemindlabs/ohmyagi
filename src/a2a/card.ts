/**
 * The Agent Card — what another agent learns about this one before talking
 * to it (S8.1, A2A 1.0.0, D-016).
 *
 * Built from the soul, never written by hand (AC1), and built from **half** of
 * it: `role.md` only. `person.md` is personal traits and, since D-046, the
 * name of whoever the identity inherits from — none of it goes on a card that
 * anyone who can reach the URL may read (AC2, I-6). The card says the agent is
 * an AI in its description and in a skill tag (I-5), because a peer reading
 * only one of them should not miss it.
 *
 * Nothing here serves the card — `ohmyagi a2a serve` does (S8.2) — and nothing
 * here reads a disk: this module only computes the JSON.
 *
 * ## The agent's public key (S15.8, D-108)
 *
 * The card announces the agent's own ed25519 public key, the one that signs its
 * usage reports, as an A2A extension in `capabilities.extensions` — the place
 * A2A gives a card for what the protocol does not define, so a client that
 * does not know the extension still reads the rest of the card. The key comes
 * in as an argument, read by the caller and never made by it: serving or
 * printing a card creates nothing. With no usable key the extension is still
 * there and says so, with nulls, because a card that simply lacked it would
 * read the same as one from before keys existed.
