/**
 * The price table: what a million tokens of one model on one backend costs, in whole US micro-dollars
 * (S15.9, D-110, D-139).
 *
 * Two tables can be in force, and a line always says which one its price came from:
 *
 * - **default** — the newest file in `shipped/`, named by its version and shipped in the binary. Dated, and
 *   each group of prices names the page it was read from and the day. Only backends whose usage can be priced
 *   are in it: claude and grok print input, output and both cache counts apart; codex prints one total, and
 *   gemini, copilot and kimi have not been surveyed, so a price for them would be a price no turn could use.
 *
 *   **A shipped file is never edited** (PR #3 review, R5). A signed report names a shipped table by version
 *   and digest, and `usage verify` holds the row to it — so a version whose content changed would turn old,
 *   honest reports into refused ones. New prices are a new file with a new version, added to
 *   {@link SHIPPED_TABLES}; the old files stay so the reports priced by them still check.
 *   `test/pricing/table.test.ts` pins every version's digest, so an edit, a note included, goes red.
 * - **owner** — `$XDG_STATE_HOME/om-agi/prices.json`, written by the owner and never by om-agi. It has the
 *   same shape. It is where a model on this machine gets a price at all (D-106: power and GPU are the owner's
 *   to price) and where an owner on a subscription says what their turns really cost them. An entry there
 *   replaces the default entry for the same backend and model; every other default entry still stands.
 *
 * ## Unknown is unknown
 *
 * A backend and model with no entry have **no price** — not a zero, and not the price of a model with a
 * similar name. Neither does a part a table leaves null (xAI publishes no cache-write price): a turn that
 * used that part is not charged. `0` is a price, and an owner who writes one is saying the turn is free.
 * The one part a table may leave out is `cache_write_1h` (D-143), and left out it is no price too: a turn
 * that wrote to the 1-hour cache is not charged, never charged at the 5-minute rate.
 *
 * ## Why an owner file that cannot be read stops all pricing
 *
 * A price file the owner wrote and got wrong is not the same as no price file. Falling back to the default
 * table would charge a hirer the list price of a model the owner meant to price at their own rate — the one
 * outcome the owner's file exists to prevent — so every turn while it is broken is recorded as not charged
 * (`table-unusable`), and `turn` and `usage prices` say why.
 *
 * Strict for the same reason: an unknown field (`cache_reads`) would otherwise leave the real field absent,
 * which reads as null, which reads as "this part has no price" — a typo quietly turning into a policy. The
 * file is parsed with the signed-report parser, which refuses a field named twice and a number written any way
 * but plain integer digits (`3e5`, `300000.0` — D-141): every number in it is a whole rate or a format
 * version, and the rates are copied into signed rows.
 *
 * Money is integers throughout — a rate is micro-dollars per million tokens, so $0.30/MTok is `300000` —
 * because a line's cost ends up in a signed report whose canonical JSON allows integers only (D-138).
