/**
 * The one rule — **a source may lower a level, never raise one** — and the

 *
 * Two owner rules are asserted here rather than described:
 *
 * 1. **The unreadable file falls to 0, not to the default.** A file om-agi
 *    cannot parse means om-agi does not know what was intended, and "carry on
 *    as usual" answers a question nobody asked.
 * 2. **Nothing is clamped in silence.** Every reduction comes back as a
 *    {@link Clamp} carrying the number that was set, the number in force, and
 *    why — including the one the *minimum* introduces, which is the lie
 *    `actLevel` would otherwise tell with arithmetic instead of with silence.
