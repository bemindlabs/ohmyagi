/**
 * The two hooks, as text — and the reasons they are shaped the way they are.
 *
 * ## Why they are generated rather than shipped as files
 *
 * `.git/hooks` is not in git and is not carried by `git clone`, so a hook is
 * not something a repository can contain; it is something a machine has to be
 * given. Generating them from constants means the sentences in the hook and the
 * sentences `ohmyagi guard status` prints are the same sentences — there is no
 * second copy to drift.
 *
 * ## Fail closed
 *
 * The pre-commit hook runs the engine, so it embeds an absolute path to it.
 * That path can stop being true: the engine moves, the checkout is deleted, bun
 * is upgraded somewhere else. When it does, the hook **blocks the commit** and
 * says how to reinstall. The alternative — warn and continue — would mean the
 * one run where the guard was broken is the run where it silently agreed.
 *
 * Embedding a path is chosen over looking `om-agi` up on PATH because om-agi is
 * not on PATH on the machine this was written on, and a hook that resolved to
 * nothing would have been the warn-and-continue case wearing a better excuse.
 *
 * ## The pre-push hook is a speed bump, and says so
 *
 * It refuses when `OM_AGI_SUBJECT` is in the environment, which is the marker
 * `cli-exec` puts on every child it starts: a push happening underneath an
 * ohmyagi turn is a push nobody typed. Otherwise it prints what a commit costs
 * (`GIT_UNDELETABLE`), says plainly that om-agi cannot see whether the remote
 * is private, and gets out of the way — because publishing is a human act
 * (D-013) and a tool that blocked it would be making that decision instead.
 *
 * `git push --no-verify` skips it entirely. That is stated in the hook's own
 * output, in `GUARD_LIMITS`, and in ADR 0002.
