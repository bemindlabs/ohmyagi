/**
 * The pre-commit scan (S0.4 AC3): what is about to enter git, and what in it
 * looks like a secret.
 *
 * Three decisions shape this file, and each of them is about not lying.
 *
 * **It reads the index, not the working tree.** A commit keeps the staged
 * blob. `git add secrets.env && $EDITOR secrets.env` leaves a clean file on
 * disk and a dirty one in the index, and a scanner that read the disk would
 * pass it. {@link scanStaged} therefore takes bytes somebody else fetched with
 * `git cat-file blob :<path>` — see `staged.ts` — and stays a pure function of
 * them, so every rule can be argued with in a unit test.
 *
 * **It never prints what it found.** A blocked commit that echoes the token
 * has put it in terminal scrollback, in a CI log, and in whatever the output
 * was piped to — none of which `ledger forget` or anything else can reach
 * (D-022). So a finding carries a path, a line number, a rule id and, for the
 * rules where it identifies nothing on its own, the first four characters.
 * Rules that match a number about a person — a national id, a payment card —
 * echo nothing at all: four digits of those is four digits of somebody.
 *
 * **It says what it cannot see, on the runs that pass.** {@link SCAN_BLIND_SPOTS}
 * is printed when the scan blocks *and* when it passes, because the person who
 * reads the word "passed" is the person about to believe the commit is safe.
 * The first entry is the largest category this project will ever handle and the
 * one no regular expression can see: personal data written as prose. A name, an
 * address, a diagnosis and a salary have no prefix, no checksum and no shape.
