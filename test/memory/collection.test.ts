/**
 * S1.6 AC4, the half that exists — the address, and the tripwire under it.
 *
 * AC4 asks that a query by B cannot reach A's memory. There is no store in this
 * repository (`rag` is registered `not-built`), so the query half cannot be
 * exercised and S4.1 owes it. What *can* be settled now is the half that would
 * otherwise be decided by whoever writes the client first: **the address**.
 *
 * Two identities are isolated in a vector store exactly when they address
 * different collections, so the two things checked here are that the name is a
 * function of the subject and that there is nowhere else in the engine — `src/`
 * or `bin/` — a name can be made. The second is the tripwire, and it is why this
 * file is not just three assertions about string concatenation: a naming rule
 * with a second implementation is not a naming rule.
