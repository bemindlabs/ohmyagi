/**
 * The same five questions, asked of a real local model — opt-in and local only.
 *
 * Run with:
 *
 *     OM_AGI_REAL_ISOLATION=1 OM_AGI_REAL_MODEL=<ollama model> \
 *       bun test test/soul/isolation.real.test.ts
 *
 * Skipped otherwise, and ollama only: I-1 says the local path has to work, and
 * spending a cloud CLI's quota to watch a model not know something is a poor
 * trade. A test that silently passed when its daemon was missing would be worse
 * than no test, so the skip is explicit and the run is loud.
 *
 * ## What this is, and what the gate is
 *
 * `test/soul/isolation.test.ts` is the gate. It proves the claim om-agi can
 * actually make — that after a switch the other identity's text is not in the
 * channel — using a backend that would repeat anything it was given.
 *
 * This file is the other half of the sentence, and it is *evidence about this
 * machine on this day*, not a property of the system. A failure here means one
 * of two things: a leak, or a model reproducing a synthetic sentence it was
 * never shown. Both are worth a human reading the raw answers, which is why
 * every one of them is printed.
 *
 * Nothing is written anywhere. The souls are synthetic (D-021) and live in a
 * temporary directory; the identity travels in the system field of each
 * request, which is gone when the request is.
