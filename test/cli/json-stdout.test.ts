/**
 * `--json` means stdout is a document — asked of every command that takes it,
 * through a pipe a person could have typed.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists at all
 *
 * As of 2026-09-22 this repository had 1331 tests and `scripts/cli-parity.ts`
 * had 128 invocations across its matrix, and **not one of them read the CLI the
 * way a human reads it**. Every single one starts the engine with
 * `Bun.spawn({ stdout: "pipe" })`, which is not a shell pipeline: measured under
 * bun 1.4.2, one `console.log` of 20001 bytes arrives whole through `Bun.spawn`
 * and can arrive cut to 8192 bytes — silently, with no error and no short write
 * reported anywhere — through `sh -c '… | cat'`, once anything in the process
 * has read `process.stdout`. Whether it is cut at all depends on how busy the
 * machine is (the numbers, and a fresh measurement on every run, are in
 * `test/cli/streams.test.ts`), which is its own hazard: it is fine on the
 * laptop and short in CI. `bin/shared.ts` read `process.stdout.isTTY` at
 * import, so that was every command, and `ohmyagi help | less` showed 8192 of
 * its 17363 bytes with the last visible line being `erase`'s usage.
 *
 * So the question "does `--json` produce JSON?" had been asked of six of the
 * seven commands that take the flag — and asked in a way that could not have
 * found this. The seventh was `erase`, and it was not an oversight either:
 * `test/cli/erase.test.ts` and `test/odd2/free-pass.test.ts` wrote
 * `JSON.parse(stdout.slice(stdout.indexOf("{")))`, which is a test shaped around
 * the bug rather than a test that reports it. That idiom arrived with S7.2's
 * first commit and was copied twice more.
 *
 * Both of those are why every row below goes through {@link runThroughPipe},
 * and why two of the rows assert that the output they just parsed was **over
 * 8192 bytes**: a guard that only ever measured short output would be green on
 * a runtime that still cuts long output, which is the failure this file is here
 * to make impossible. Those two rows are safe to assert — they say the whole
 * document arrived, which held in every condition measured once the engine
 * stopped reading the getter. What the getter *does* is load-dependent and is
 * therefore reported rather than asserted, over in `test/cli/streams.test.ts`.
 *
 * ## What "a document" means, and the two answers that are allowed
 *
 * Under `--json`, stdout is either:
 *
 * - one JSON document, parseable **whole** — `JSON.parse(stdout)`, no slicing,
 *   no scanning for a brace; or
 * - empty, with a non-zero exit code, for a command line the CLI would not run.
 *
 * Everything a human would want to read goes to stderr. `observe actions` has
 * done this since it was written (`say()` in `bin/commands/observe.ts`) and is
 * the shape the others are held to.
 *
 * ## Why a new command goes red by itself
 *
 * The sites are found by walking each file's syntax tree for an array literal
 * holding `"json"` — which catches both `parseArgs(argv, ["json", …])` and a
 * named constant like `WORN_BOOLEANS`. A file with such a list and no row in
 * {@link ROWS} is reported as `unasked`, and a row naming a file that no longer
 * declares the flag is reported too. Neither can be satisfied by editing this
 * comment.
