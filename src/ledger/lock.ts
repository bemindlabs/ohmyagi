/**
 * The ledger's lock (D-145): one writer at a time, a wait instead of a refusal, and a dead writer's lock
 * broken only on evidence.
 *
 * ## Why it waits
 *
 * The lock used to be a bare `mkdir`, and a writer that found it taken threw at once. Every `turn` appends
 * after its answer has come back, so two turns that finished together raced for it, and the loser — whose
 * prompt had already gone to a vendor — exited "sent and not recorded". Measured on that code: two turns
 * with an instant stub lost a line in 10 rounds of 10; eight processes appending at once lost 7 of 8. A
 * ledger that drops lines exactly when it is busy is not a record of what was sent.
 *
 * So a writer that finds the lock taken waits for it: backoff from 5 ms doubling to 50 ms, jittered so that
 * waiters do not wake in step, for at most `waitMs` in total — 5 s when a turn asks before it sends
 * and for a line written before a send ({@link LOCK_TIMING}), a minute for a turn's line after its answer
 * ({@link RECORD_TIMING}). Only `EEXIST` is waited on.
 * Any other `mkdir` failure is thrown as it came, because "permission denied" is not "busy" and dressing it
 * up as a lock sends a person looking for a process that does not exist.
 *
 * ## What is on disk
 *
 * `<ledger dir>/.lock/owner.<uuid>.json` — `{"pid":…,"host":"…","started":"<ISO time>"}`, 600 in a 700
 * directory. The owner is written to a temporary name inside `.lock` and renamed, so a reader sees all of it
 * or none of it. After the rename the writer lists `.lock`: it holds the lock only if its own owner file is
 * the **only** thing there. Anything else means somebody else also believes they made this directory — see
 * the last section — and both step back.
 *
 * ## When a lock is stale — never guessed
 *
 * A lock is broken only on evidence:
 *
 * - its owner is on **this host** and gone: `kill(pid, 0)` says `ESRCH`, or the owner started before this
 *   machine last booted (a pid from before a boot can belong to anything now); or
 * - its owner has not been heard from for more than `maxAgeMs`, wherever it runs: not since it started, and
 *   not since its last heartbeat — a holder touches its owner file every quarter of `maxAgeMs` while it
 *   holds the lock, so a live long hold (a `forget` of a big ledger) never looks abandoned, and a process
 *   that is stopped or wedged stops touching it. That is the only rule for an owner on another host, whose
 *   pid means nothing here — and for every owner when the caller could not say which machine this is. The host name and boot time are handed in as {@link ThisMachine}, like every other
 *   fact about the machine (D-021); `ledgerEnv()` in `bin/shared.ts` is where they are read.
 * - Anything in `.lock` that is not a readable owner — an owner still being renamed into place, one a dead
 *   writer left half made, an empty `.lock` (an om-agi older than D-145 holds its lock as an empty
 *   directory) — counts as stale only once it is older than `graceMs`.
 *
 * `EPERM` from `kill` is a live process of another user's, not a dead one. And something in the lock's way
 * that om-agi did not make and cannot remove — a file where `.lock` should be, a directory inside it — is
 * never removed and never waited for: the writer stops at once and names it ({@link LedgerLocked} is only
 * for a lock somebody holds).
 *
 * ## Breaking a lock, when two waiters try at once
 *
 * The breaker unlinks the **owner file by its name**, then `rmdir`s `.lock`. The name is the owner's own
 * uuid, so of any number of waiters that judged the same owner stale exactly one unlink succeeds; the rest get
 * `ENOENT` and touch nothing. A late waiter — one that judged the old owner stale and was then descheduled
 * while somebody else broke it and took the lock — unlinks a name that is no longer there: the new holder's
 * file has another uuid. And `rmdir` removes only an empty directory, while a held lock always has its owner
 * file in it. Nothing here ever removes a lock it did not look inside first, and nothing is removed
 * recursively.
 *
 * The one directory that *can* be empty and still wanted is a lock between its `mkdir` and its owner — and
 * that is what the check after the rename is for. If a waiter removes it there, the writer's rename fails with
 * `ENOENT`, or lands in the next writer's directory beside that writer's owner; either way the listing shows
 * it is not alone, and it tries again. Mutual exclusion does not depend on `graceMs` at all
 * (`test/ledger/lock.test.ts` runs the race with it at zero); the grace period exists so that a writer is not
 * kicked out mid-`mkdir`, and so that an older om-agi's empty directory is waited for rather than removed.

 * The numbers, measured rather than chosen (2026-09-29, bun 1.4.2, NVMe ext4). One append — open, write a
 * line, `fsync`, close — took 6.2 ms at the median and 15 ms at worst over 300. Eight processes appending at
 * the same instant: the last of them was done 140 ms later at the median of ten rounds, 242 ms at worst —
 * most of it spent in backoff, not on the disk.
 *
 * - **5 s wait.** Twenty times the worst eight-way round, and room for a disk whose `fsync` takes hundreds
 *   of milliseconds. A lock held longer than that by a live process is not an append — it is something
 *   stuck, and a turn should say so rather than hang. `canAppend` waits this long, so a lock held that long
 *   refuses a turn *before* its prompt is sent. After the send it is {@link RECORD_TIMING} instead.
 * - **2 s grace.** The gap it covers — `mkdir` to owner, or an older om-agi's whole append — is under a
 *   millisecond to a few; two seconds is hundreds of times that, and short enough that a writer can clear a
 *   dead one's leftover inside one wait.
 * - **10 minutes max age.** A hundred thousand times one append, and longer than any `forget` of a real
 *   ledger. It only decides the cases the pid cannot: an owner on another host sharing this state
 *   directory, or a pid taken over by another process. Breaking a live lock by age lets two writers in — two
 *   appends still both land (`O_APPEND`), but a `forget` could replace a file under a line — so it is set
 *   where only a stuck process reaches it.
