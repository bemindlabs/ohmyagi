/**
 * D-154 — the loop that carries a task: plan, step, observe, decide next, until the goal is reached, the budget
 * is spent, or somebody stops it.
 *
 * Pure of processes: everything that touches the world — running a step's turn, the brake, the browser, the
 * clock — is handed in ({@link RunnerDeps}), so every branch is tested without a model. `bin/commands/task.ts`
 * wires the real ones; `spawn-turn.ts` is the one that runs `ohmyagi turn`.
 *
 * ## Each step is an ordinary turn
 *
 * The runner does not talk to a backend. It writes the step's prompt and runs `ohmyagi turn` with it, as a
 * child — the way a trigger does (D-054) — so the ledger, the dial, the fence, egress, recall, the run record
 * that `ohmyagi stop` finds, and D-043's report all apply to every step exactly as to a typed message. A step's
 * turn is refused by everything a typed one is refused by.
 *
 * ## One runner at a time, and after a crash
 *
 * A runner claims a *generation* before it touches the record: `runners/<n>.json`, linked into place
 * (`linkClaim`, D-144's exclusive step), where `n` is one more than the record's. Two `task resume` at once both
 * read the same record and race for the same name; one gets it. A claim whose process is gone (pid and start
 * time, as run records check them) is passed over to the next number — nothing is ever unlinked, so a late
 * process cannot remove a live claim.
 *
 * A runner that dies leaves the record as it was: a status that needs a runner, with none alive behind it
 * (`interrupted`, `shownStatus`), and possibly a step with no end. The next runner closes that step as
 * `interrupted` — it counts as a turn spent, because its turn may have reached a backend — tells the next
 * step's turn so, and carries on from there. The browser does not survive: the old container's owner is gone,
 * so the sweep ends it, and the new runner brings up a fresh one (a clean profile, D-151).
 *
 * ## When the backend is not there (S18.2)
 *
 * Before every step the runner asks {@link RunnerDeps.backendReady}. While the answer is no — the local model asleep
 * because media-gen has the GPU, or down — the task is `waiting-backend`: no step starts, so no turn is spent and no
 * minute counts (the budget's minutes are the steps' own time). A step whose turn got no answer and whose backend
 * is found not ready right after is `no-backend`, not `failed`: it counts against nothing. A wait that passes its
 * limit ({@link DEFAULT_BACKEND_WAIT_MINUTES}, or the task's own) parks the task — `parked`, with the reason, no
 * runner; `task resume` carries it on and `task stop` ends it. Not `failed`: nothing about the task went wrong.
 *
 * ## Ended from outside (S18.1)
 *
 * A runner in a unit of its own is sent SIGTERM when that unit is stopped. With a stop asked (`task stop`,
 * `ohmyagi stop`, erase) that is {@link RunnerDeps.stopping}; with none — the user's manager going down for a reboot
 * — it is {@link RunnerDeps.leaving}: the runner ends its step's turn, closes the step as interrupted and leaves the
 * task as a crash would, for `task resume`, but with the record written.
