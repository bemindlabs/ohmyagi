/**
 * The brake — layer one, whose whole mechanism is that a file exists.
 *
 * The cases here are mostly about what the brake refuses to be: it has no
 * format, so it cannot be malformed; it is not in git, so it cannot travel to a
 * machine nobody stopped; and "I cannot tell" reads as stopped, because the safe
 * reading of an unanswerable question is the same as the safe reading of an
 * unparseable dial.
