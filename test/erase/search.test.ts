/**
 * AC3 — "ค้นตัวระบุของ subject ทั้งระบบได้ 0 ผลลัพธ์", and the definition of
 * *ทั้งระบบ* that has to be printed beside the zero.
 *
 * Two kinds of test here, and they are about different failures.
 *
 * The first kind is precision: `demo` must be found in `subject = "demo"` and
 * not in `demonstration`, because a search that fires on every longer word
 * makes every run report a remainder and teaches whoever reads it to ignore the
 * number. The subject alphabet is `[a-z0-9_-]`, so that is where the boundary
 * comes from — not `\b`, which would split on the dash a subject id may
 * legitimately contain.
 *
 * The second kind is honesty about what this cannot do. Free text has no
 * boundary to take, Thai has no word boundary at all, and the assertions at the
 * bottom hold `SEARCH_LIMITS` to saying so — because the alternative is a
 * count somebody reads as precise. The same tests hold `NOT_SEARCHED` to naming
 * vendor transcripts and git objects, which is where the data actually is on
 * the day somebody is disappointed.
