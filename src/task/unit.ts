/**
 * S18.1 (D-164, AO-1) — a detached task runner in a systemd unit of its own.
 *
 * ## Why
 *
 * `task new|resume --detach` used to start the runner as a detached child of whoever ran it. Started from the web
 * page, that is a child of `ohmyagi web` — and under a service manager a detached child is still in its parent's
 * cgroup. `ohmyagi-web-om.service` has `KillMode=mixed`, so every restart of the web (an upgrade, a crash, a key
 * change) SIGKILLed every task the page had started, mid-step. Now, whenever a user systemd manager answers, the
 * runner is a transient unit of its own, `om-agi-task-<id>.service`, started with `systemd-run --user`, and the
 * web can restart under it.
 *
 * | property | why |
 * |---|---|
 * | `--collect` | the unit is gone when the runner ends, also when it failed — the next `resume` can use the name |
 * | `KillMode=mixed` | a stop sends SIGTERM to the runner alone, which ends its step's turn the way `ohmyagi stop` does (D-044) and writes the record; whatever is left after {@link UNIT_STOP_SECONDS} is SIGKILLed |
 * | `TimeoutStopSec` | room for that: D-044's ~4 s per turn, the browser's `docker kill`, one write |
 * | `Restart=no` | a runner is never restarted by systemd; resuming is a decision (the tick's, AO-1/AO-2 — later) |
 * | `SuccessExitStatus` | the runner's own exit codes (failed, budget, stopped, parked, left for resume) are outcomes of the task: the unit is not shown as failed for them |
 * | `Type=exec` | `systemd-run` returns only once the runner was really started, so a failure is seen here |
 *
 * ## The environment, and why not `--setenv`
 *
 * A unit gets its manager's environment, not its starter's, so the runner's environment has to be carried. What it
 * needs is the starter's whole environment — what a detached child inherited before: `HOME`, the XDG roots, `PATH`
 * (the vendor CLIs), the `OM_AGI_*` settings, and whatever key a backend reads from it (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, …).
 * That last kind is secret, and `systemd-run --setenv` writes every value into the unit's properties, which
 * `systemctl --user show` prints to anyone who asks. So no value goes through `--setenv` or argv: the environment
 * is written to `runner-env-<random>` in the task's own directory (personal, 700) with mode 600, and handed to the
 * unit as `EnvironmentFile=` — the unit's properties hold its path, never its values. systemd reads it when it
 * starts the runner; with `Type=exec`, `systemd-run` returns only after that, and the file is removed then, whatever
 * happened ({@link startRunner}). Measured 2026-10-06 against systemd's own parser: every value is written double-
 * quoted with `\`, `"`, `$` and `` ` `` escaped, and comes back byte for byte — quotes, `$HOME`, newlines, tabs,
 * trailing spaces. A name systemd cannot carry (`BASH_FUNC_x%%`) is left out.
 *
 * The runner itself does not need to know: its environment is what its starter's was.
 *
 * A leftover `runner-env-*` older than a minute (the starter died between writing and removing it) is swept on the
 * next start ({@link sweepStaleEnvFiles}).
 *
 * ## Lingering
 *
 * A user manager exists while its user is logged in. For a task to outlive the login, and to start after a reboot
 * with nobody logged in, the owner enables lingering once: `loginctl enable-linger <user>`. Without it the unit
 * ends with the last session — which is today's behaviour for a detached child too, only now it is a clean
 * SIGTERM that leaves the task for `task resume`.
 *
 * ## Without systemd
 *
 * No user manager (a container, macOS, `OM_AGI_NO_SYSTEMD=1`, a `systemd-run` that fails): today's detached child,
 * and one line on stderr saying it will end with whatever started it.
