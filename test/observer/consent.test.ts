/**
 * The one decision om-agi will not make for its owner — and the three ways the
 * mechanism could quietly stop working.
 *
 * 1. **Somebody other than the owner says yes.** There is no `--yes`, and the
 *    acceptance needs a terminal and an exact phrase. That does not prove a
 *    person; it proves a terminal, which is stated in `CAPTURE_LIMITS` and
 *    asserted at the bottom of this file so that deleting the admission breaks
 *    a test.
 * 2. **A refusal leaves something behind.** A "no" has to leave no trace of
 *    having been asked — not a directory, not a file, not a record.
 * 3. **The words change and the consent does not.** This is the one that would
 *    rot silently: a release adds a captured field, the owner never sees the
 *    new list, and capture continues under an agreement to something else. The
 *    digest is what stops it, and the test for it changes the *words* rather
 *    than the hash, because hashing the hash proves nothing.
