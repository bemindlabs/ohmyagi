/**
 * Proposals — what was asked for before it was done, and the refusals nobody is
 * allowed to forget.
 *
 * ## Why this is not in the ledger (D-029)
 *
 * S5.2 AC2 asks for a memory: *การปฏิเสธถูกจำ — ไม่เสนอเรื่องเดิมซ้ำโดยไม่มีอะไรใหม่*.
 * A memory is something read back into the next decision, and the ledger is the
 * one store in om-agi that may never be read back into one (S2.2 AC5, D-022):
 * `ledger forget` would otherwise bring back every proposal the owner had
 * already said no to. The owner decided on 2026-09-22 (D-029) that proposals and
 * their outcomes get a **store of their own**, D-022 is not relaxed, and the
 * guard over it (`test/ledger/read-back.test.ts`) is not touched.
 *
 * So nothing here imports `src/ledger/`, and nothing in `src/ledger/` knows this
 * file exists. The two record different things: the ledger records that a turn
 * *happened*, this records what was *asked and answered*.
 *
 * ## The address, and why it is not a sixth place
 *
 * `$XDG_DATA_HOME/om-agi/<subject>/personal/proposals/<id>.json` — under
 * {@link import("../guard/personal.ts").personalDir}, the same tree raw capture
 * lives in (D-025). `what`, `why` and `impact` are free text about what the
 * owner does, which is the one category that may not be in git at all (S3.2 AC5,
 * D-014), and three properties come with that address rather than being
 * re-implemented here: the path is refused outright if it resolves inside a git
 * repository, the pre-commit scan's `personal-path` rule blocks anything staged
 * under a `personal/` directory at any depth, and the tree is created 0700.
 *
 * It is deliberately *not* a sixth `PlaceId`. S7.2 AC1 names five places and
 * `src/erase/places.ts` is closed to exactly those five; D-025 refused to put a
 * personal record outside `personal/` for this reason, and the same argument
 * applies here word for word. The cost is that `tsc` would not go red if
 * somebody moved this store out from under `personal/` — so
 * `test/decide/proposals.test.ts` asserts the containment, and
 * `test/erase/plan.test.ts` measures the consequence: a canary seeded here is
 * gone after `erase`, and a control file placed outside `personal/` is not.
 *
 * ## Deleting this store is allowed to change something
 *
 * Unlike the ledger, whose whole promise is that removing it changes nothing,
 * removing this one makes the agent forget that it was told no. That is not a
 * side effect — it is this store's entire job, and `rm` is how an owner says
 * *ask me again*. One file per proposal, so that is true of one refusal too.
 *
 * ## "The same thing" is exact, and the miss is said out loud
 *
 * {@link proposalKey} is NFC, trim, collapse runs of whitespace, lower-case.
 * That is all of it, and it is describable in one sentence on purpose: a fuzzy
 * comparison decides for the owner which two requests are "really" the same, and
 * gets it wrong in both directions without saying so. The cost is real and is
 * not hidden — **change one word in `what` and the refusal no longer bites**. It
 * is paid for at the other end: every command that files or decides a proposal
 * prints the subject's refusals in full, every time, so that the wide comparison
 * is made by a person looking at the list rather than by a regular expression
 * pretending to.
 *
 * `--changed <text>` is the declared way past a refusal, and it is recorded:
 * {@link Proposal.supersedes} names the proposal it is answering and
 * {@link Proposal.changed} says what is new. Somebody who wants to slip a
 * refused idea through can still reword `what`; the difference is that this way
 * leaves a record saying they did.
 *
 * ## An approval is spent once
 *
 * The owner's decision, 2026-09-22: *"อนุมัติต่อ proposal และใช้ได้ครั้งเดียว"* —
 * per proposal, and good for one turn. A standing approval is how "I allowed it
 * once" becomes "it has been doing that ever since", with nothing to show when
 * the old permission was used again. {@link spendability} refuses a second turn.
 *
 * "Once" has to hold for two turns that start together, too: two taps on the
 * page's "Do it now", or the app's "Run now", are two `turn` processes that
 * each read the record as unspent (D-144). Reading and then rewriting a record
 * cannot settle that, however close together the two steps are — so the spend
 * is not a rewrite. {@link claimApproval} *creates* `spent/<id>.json` with
 * `link(2)`, which fails with `EEXIST` for everyone after the first: one
 * exclusive step, on any number of processes, with nothing to hold and so no
 * lock to go stale. The file is written whole and synced before it is linked,
 * so a turn that lost can always say which turn won. One claim per **id**, so
 * two records that carry the same id — a copy somebody made — are spent once
 * between them. {@link readProposals} folds every claim into its record, so each
 * reader sees the spend whether or not the record's own copy of it was
 * written; the copy is for somebody reading the file.
 *
 * Nothing takes a claim back (D-144 §2, the owner's decision of 2026-09-29): an
 * approval a failed turn took stays spent. A killed turn could not hand it back,
 * and one that reached a backend may have acted. When that turn sent nothing at
 * all, `turn` marks the record {@link Proposal.sentNothing}, and it may be
 * asked for again — a new proposal from its own record, once
 * ({@link refileProblem}). "Once" is claimed the way a spend is
 * ({@link claimRefile}, `refiled/<id>.json`), before the new record is
 * written: a bulk "File it again" read by six processes at once files one.
 *
 * ## Paths are never built from an argument
 *
 * A caller looks a proposal up by reading the directory and matching
 * {@link Proposal.id}, never by joining the id onto a path — see
 * {@link findProposal}. A record is only ever rewritten at the path it was read
 * from ({@link writeProposalAt}), never at one built from its `id` field; and an
 * id that is not one plain file name ({@link isProposalId}) makes the file no
 * record at all, so a hand-edited `../../escaped` can reach no path — not a
 * rewrite, not a claim, not a triage. `proposal new` mints ids with
 * `crypto.randomUUID()`. `../../etc/passwd` from a command line is therefore not
 * a filename here; it is an id that matches no record.
 *
 * ## An approval is bound to the action (D-153)
 *
 * Before this, `turn --proposal <id>` spent the approval on whatever prompt the
 * caller sent with it: an approval for "rotate the logs" paid for any turn
 * (e2e finding 6, `notes/2026-10-04_e2e-actions.md`). Now every record carries
 * a canonical {@link ProposalAction} — for a turn, the prompt, which is its
 * `what` word for word — and its digest ({@link actionDigest}). `proposal
 * decide --approve` writes that digest into the decision, so the yes names
 * exactly what it said yes to. {@link boundAction} is what a turn asks: the
 * action to run, built from the record and from nothing the caller sent, or
 * why it may not run — the record no longer matches the digest that was
 * approved. A turn that is handed a prompt as well refuses it unless it is the
 * approved one.
 *
 * An approval with no digest is refused, with "approve it again": one given
 * before this existed (D-144 is unreleased, and they are few), or one whose
 * digest was stripped. Honouring it would let an edit — `what` changed, the
 * digest and `action` deleted — run as a "legacy" approval (review of PR #18,
 * measured). Such an approval — like one whose record no longer matches its digest —
 * is never listed as runnable: {@link needsReapproval} lists it apart, and it is filed again from its own record as a new proposal
 * waiting for a new yes — once, claimed like any refile ({@link refileProblem}).
 * Asking again is safe whichever it was: nothing runs until somebody approves the
 * new record, whose digest is bound to its own `what`.
 *
 * **What the digest is, and is not.** It catches a record that *changed*
 * after the yes — a slip, a stale copy, an edit that did not bother to cover
 * itself. It does not stop somebody *determined* to edit the record: the
 * digest is a plain sha256 in the same file, and anything that can write the
 * state root — which a vendor CLI running as the owner can — can recompute it.
 * The same limit D-042 states for level-3 confirmations; the real boundary is
 * a separate uid or a sandbox, outside om-agi.
