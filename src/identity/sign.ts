/**
 * Sign a JSON payload with an agent's own ed25519 key, and check one (S15.8, D-106, D-108, D-138).
 *
 * Pure: no filesystem, no network, no clock. The key arrives as a `KeyObject` and the envelope leaves as a
 * value; where the key is kept is `key.ts`'s business.
 *
 * ## The bytes that are signed — the contract with whoever verifies
 *
 * The marketplace (S16.4) and anyone holding a report must be able to rebuild exactly the bytes that were
 * signed, in any language, from the envelope alone. So:
 *
 *   signature = Ed25519(privateKey, UTF-8(canonicalJson(envelope.payload)))
 *
 * - **Ed25519** is RFC 8032's pure Ed25519 — not Ed25519ph, no context string. Deterministic: one key and
 *   one payload always give one signature, which is what lets a test pin a vector.
 * - **`canonicalJson`** is RFC 8785 (the JSON Canonicalization Scheme) restricted to integers:
 *   - an object's members are written in the order of their names' UTF-16 code units (JavaScript's default
 *     string sort, which is JCS §3.2.3), each name once;
 *   - an array keeps its order;
 *   - no whitespace at all: `,` between members and elements, `:` between a name and its value;
 *   - a string is written as ECMAScript's `JSON.stringify` writes it (JCS §3.2.2.2): `"` and `\` escaped,
 *     U+0008/0009/000A/000C/000D as `\b` `\t` `\n` `\f` `\r`, the other controls below U+0020 as `\u00xx`
 *     in lower-case hex, and every other character as itself — non-ASCII, `/`, U+007F, U+2028 and U+2029
 *     are not escaped. A string with a lone surrogate is refused: it has no UTF-8 form;
 *   - a number must be an integer of magnitude at most 2^53 − 1, written in plain decimal (`-0` as `0`).
 *     Fractions and exponents are refused rather than formatted: every language agrees on how to print an
 *     integer, and not all of them agree with JCS about 1e21;
 *   - `true`, `false` and `null` as themselves. Nothing else is JSON, and nothing else is accepted.
 *
 *   Any JCS implementation therefore produces the same bytes for anything this module accepts. For payloads
 *   whose member names are ASCII — every payload om-agi signs — so does Python's
 *   `json.dumps(payload, sort_keys=True, separators=(",", ":"), ensure_ascii=False).encode("utf-8")`.
 * - **The payload must carry a string `kind`** (`ohmyagi.usage-report` for a usage report, `ohmyagi.key-proof`
 *   for a proof of holding the key — `proof.ts`, D-141). One key may come to sign
 *   more than one kind of thing, and a verifier that checks `kind` cannot be shown a signature over one kind
 *   as if it were another.
 *
 * ## The envelope
 *
 *   { "v": 1, "algorithm": "ed25519", "publicKey": <b64url>, "fingerprint": <16 hex>,
 *     "payload": { "kind": …, … }, "signature": <b64url> }
 *
 * - `publicKey` — the 32-byte RFC 8032 public key, base64url without padding (the `x` of its JWK).
 * - `signature` — the 64-byte signature, base64url without padding.
 * - `fingerprint` — the first 16 lower-case hex digits of SHA-256 over the 32 public-key bytes. For a person
 *   to compare with the agent card; it is 64 bits and nothing should be *pinned* to it. Pin the whole key.
 * - Only `payload` is signed. The rest says how to check it: a swapped `publicKey` does not verify unless it
 *   signed the payload itself, and then it is a different agent — which is what comparing with the card, or
 *   `--key`, is for.
 *
 * ## What is refused before the curve is asked (S15.8 security review, M1)
 *
 * OpenSSL's Ed25519 — which `node:crypto` is under Bun — verifies whatever it is handed. With the identity
 * point as the public key and `R = identity, S = 0`, *every* payload verifies: anyone can "sign" for that key,
 * so a report under it proves nothing, even with `--key` pinned to it. So this module does what libsodium's
 * `crypto_sign_verify_detached` does, before any curve arithmetic:
 *
 * - **the public key** must encode `y < p` (canonical) and must not be one of the eight points of small order
 *   or their non-canonical encodings — libsodium's blocklist, compared with the sign bit masked as it does;
 * - **`R`**, the first half of the signature, must not be a small-order point either;
 * - **`S`**, the second half, must be below the group order `L` (RFC 8032 §5.1.7), checked here rather than
 *   left to whichever library is underneath.
 *
 * The same test applies to a key given to check against (`--key`), so a weak key cannot be pinned. The
 * rejected encodings are test vectors in `test/identity/sign.test.ts`, beside the fixed signing vector, for
 * the marketplace's verifier to hold itself to (D-138).
 *
 * ## Duplicate member names
 *
 * RFC 8785 forbids them and `JSON.parse` keeps the last, so an envelope with two `rows` could show one
 * reader the signed rows and another the unsigned ones. Text is read with `parseJsonStrict`
 * (`strict-json.ts`), which refuses a duplicate anywhere; this module is handed values.
 *
 * ## Numbers in one spelling (D-141 §4)
 *
 * The signature is over the canonical bytes, so `151250`, `151250.0` and `1.5125e5` in the text all verify: the
 * value is the same. `parseJsonStrict` refuses every spelling but the plain integer digits, so a signed NUMBER
 * has one spelling. Strings still have several (`\u0041` is `A`, `\/` is `/`) and whitespace is free, so a signed
 * payload does not have one text: every reader decodes those the same, but anything that dedupes must key on the
 * decoded values (e.g. a row's id), never on a hash of the text (PR #4 review).
