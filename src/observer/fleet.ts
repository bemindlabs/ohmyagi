/**
 * Whose data a capture lands in — the answer D-036 gave OPEN-1.
 *
 * claude 2.1.280 stopped sending the `source` field `deriveOrigin` was built
 * on, so a hook can no longer tell the owner's turn from a fleet launcher's
 * `claude -p`. The owner chose to move the question from a label on each
 * record to the boundary between subjects: a fleet launcher declares itself
 * with `OM_AGI_FLEET=<subject>`, and its work goes to that subject instead of
 * the one the hook names.
 *
 * ## Why an environment variable
 *
 * claude merges hooks from every settings layer, so a launcher passing its own
 * `--settings` cannot remove the one in `~/.claude/settings.json`. The
 * environment is the one thing a launcher controls that the hook's process is
 * certain to inherit. `OM_AGI_SUBJECT` was not reused: it already means "this
 * process runs under om-agi's `cli-exec`", and the guard hook refuses pushes
 * on it.
 *
 * ## The direction it fails in
 *
 * A marker that is present but not a subject id records nothing, and does not
 * fall back to the hook's subject. A launcher that templated
 * `OM_AGI_FLEET=${NAME}` with an empty name has still said "I am the fleet",
 * and the owner's data is the one place that sentence must not end up.
 *
 * ## What this does not do
 *
 * An unmarked session is not promoted to `owner-prompted`. It is a session
 * that did not declare itself, which is weaker, and `deriveOrigin` keeps saying
 * `unknown` for it. The launcher that forgot is caught by {@link fleetLeaks},
 * which counts and changes nothing.
