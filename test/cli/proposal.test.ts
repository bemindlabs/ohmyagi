/**
 * `ohmyagi proposal`, and the two things D-029 said had to be measured.
 *
 * ## The first: deleting this store changes exactly one thing
 *
 * D-022 says of the ledger that removing it must change *nothing*. This store
 * is the opposite case on purpose, and the difference is the whole reason it
 * exists separately: remove it and the agent forgets it was told no, which is
 * this store's job rather than a side effect. Both halves are measured here —
 * a refusal that stops a repeat, and stops stopping it once `rm -rf` has been
 * run; and a turn with no `--proposal` that is **byte-identical** before and
 * after, on stdout, on stderr through the declared normalisers, and on its exit
 * code. That second half is the shape `test/ledger/read-back.test.ts` uses for
 * the ledger, borrowed rather than reinvented, and it is what says the store is
 * not quietly in the path of ordinary work.
 *
 * ## The second: an approval is spent once
 *
 * `turn --proposal <id>` claims the approval at the check, before anything else
 * happens, and a second turn naming the same id is refused with 4 — including
 * one started at the same moment, since the claim is one exclusive step across
 * processes; and a turn that fails after its claim keeps it spent (D-144). The alternative — an
 * approval that keeps working — is how "I allowed it once" becomes "it has been
 * doing that ever since", and the owner decided against it on 2026-09-22.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the operator's home, spends a vendor turn, or reaches a
 * network: every run gets a temporary `HOME`, a `PATH` holding one symlink to
 * `bun` (checked by {@link expectNoVendorOn}), and a stub ollama on loopback.
