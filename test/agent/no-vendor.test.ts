/**
 * I-1, for `new` and `rebuild`: no model, no vendor CLI, not even reachable.
 *
 * The obvious test — empty `PATH`, run the command, see it work — does not
 * prove anything on this class of machine. A short `PATH` is not the absence of
 * a vendor CLI when one is installed in a system directory, and a subprocess
 * that inherits an environment can find things the test did not intend to give
 * it. What can be proven instead is stronger and cheaper: **there is no code
 * path from `src/agent/` to `src/exec/` at all.** Not "it did not call one this
 * time" — it cannot, because the module graph does not reach it.
 *
 * The check walks the graph transitively on purpose. `src/agent/*` imports from
 * `src/soul/`, and `src/soul/index.ts` re-exports `verify.ts`, which does reach
 * `src/exec/`. So the rule the agent layer actually lives by is "import the soul
 * modules you need, never the barrel" — and a test that only looked one level
 * deep would have missed the day somebody reached for the barrel instead.
 *
 * The last test covers the one subprocess this layer causes. It used to pin the
 * set of commands spawned under `src/agent/` by matching the text
 * `Bun.spawn(["…"`, and S0.4 retired that check for being exactly the kind of
 * gate this project is about: it could only see a spawn whose first argument
 * was a literal array, so it was blind to `Bun.spawn(argv)` in `cli-exec.ts`.
 * Since S0.4 there is one chokepoint, `src/spawn.ts`, and the property worth
 * asserting here is stronger and simpler — **nothing under `src/agent/` holds a
 * spawn primitive at all.** What it may do is go through the chokepoint, whose
 * argv policy is checked in `test/guard/no-push.test.ts`.
