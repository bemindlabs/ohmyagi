/**
 * "Is this path inside a git repository?" — one walk, and nothing else.
 *
 * This lived in `src/agent/new.ts` until S3.5 (w2), and moving it was not
 * tidying. `new.ts` imports the spawn chokepoint, because `ohmyagi new` runs
 * `git init`. Every module that asked this question therefore dragged the
 * ability to start a process into its own import closure — including
 * `src/guard/personal.ts`, which is what the observer store is built on.
 *
 * S3.5 AC2 is checked by walking the observer's import closure and requiring
 * that `src/spawn.ts` and `src/exec/` are not in it: a module that cannot reach
 * a subprocess cannot reach a network stack with extra steps either. With this
 * function still in `new.ts`, the only ways to pass that check would have been
 * to exempt the chokepoint — which is how a gate stops being one — or to give
 * the observer its own copy of the walk, which is how two copies drift.
 *
 * So the walk sits on its own, importing `node:fs` and `node:path` and nothing
 * else. It is a question about the filesystem and never runs `git`: asking the
 * binary would need a subprocess for an answer a `stat` already has, and the
 * answer has to be available to code that is not allowed to spawn one.

 * Three callers need it, each to refuse a destination rather than to use one:

 * imported soul carries host paths and account names), and `personalDir` (data
 * flagged personal must not be inside version control at all — D-014, I-4).
 *
 * `.git` is checked for existence rather than for being a directory: in a
 * worktree or a submodule it is a file, and both of those are still very much
