/**
 * What recall is built from — the files in git, cut into pieces a search can
 * return (D-037, S4.1 AC5).
 *
 * The source of truth for an agent's knowledge is `memory/**\/*.md` in its own
 * repository. Everything S4.1 writes elsewhere — the full-text file under
 * `.dagi/index/`, the vector collection in Qdrant — is derived from what this
 * file returns, and must be rebuildable from it alone. So this is pure over
 * the file contents, and the id of each piece is a hash of *where it came
 * from*, never of when it was read: two rebuilds over the same tree produce the
 * same ids, which is what lets "drop the index and build it again" be checked
 * rather than hoped.
 *
 * ## How a file is cut
 *
 * At its headings (`#` through `######`), so a piece is something a person
 * wrote as one section. A section longer than {@link CHUNK_MAX} is split again
 * at blank lines, and a paragraph longer than that at the limit itself — a hit
 * that returns ten thousand characters is not a recall, it is a file.
