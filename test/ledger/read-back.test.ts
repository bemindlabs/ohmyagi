/**
 * S2.2 AC5 / D-022 — nothing reads the ledger back into a decision.
 *
 * The sentence being guarded is: *"ledger ไม่เป็นแหล่งความจริงของสิ่งใดที่ agent
 * ต้องใช้ — ไม่มีโค้ดใดอ่าน ledger กลับเข้า prompt/ความจำ/การตัดสินใจ · ลบทิ้งแล้ว
 * พฤติกรรม agent เท่าเดิมทุกอย่าง"*. `recon1` measured on 2026-09-22 that it held:
 * exactly one caller of `query()` existed, in `bin/commands/ledger.ts`, and it
 * called it to print a table. What it also found is that **nothing tested it** —
 * so a task that read the ledger back into a prompt would have landed green, and
 * E5 is the epic whose whole job is to give an agent something to decide with.
 *
 * Two layers, because one of them alone would be the wrong shape.
 *
 * ## Layer A — structural, over the whole tree
 *
 * The question is *who receives ledger content?*, and the answer is pinned as an
 * **allowance on the write side** rather than a denylist of read verbs. A
 * denylist has to name `query`, then `read`, then `tail`, then whatever the next
 * reader is called, and it is wrong the moment somebody picks a word nobody
 * thought of — that is the lesson `w9`/grok left behind, and it is the one that
 * matters here. The write side is the opposite kind of list: S2.2 AC2 closed it
 * (`append` is the only writing operation there is, and there will not be a
 * second), so it is a list that stays still.
 *
 * So: any file outside `src/ledger/` may take a name out of `src/ledger/` only if
 * the name is on {@link WRITE_SIDE}, or the file is one of the {@link READERS}
 * and the name is one that reader declares. Everything else is a read, whether it
 * is called `query` today or `tail` tomorrow.
 *
 * Erased names are free, and the freedom is checked at the declaration rather
 * than at the import: `LedgerEntry` is an interface, so no spelling of importing
 * it can move a byte. `import type { query }` would be free too and would also be
 * useless, which is the same fact from the other side.
 *
 * ## Layer B — behavioural, over the sentence itself
 *
 * Layer A guards a mechanism. D-022's promise is about behaviour, and the two are
 * not the same claim: a mechanism can be intact while the promise is broken by a
 * path the mechanism does not cover. So a ledger holding a canary is put on disk,
 * a real `ohmyagi turn` is run against a stub daemon that records what it was
 * handed, and then the ledger is deleted and the same turn is run again. The
 * canary must never reach the backend, stdout or stderr; and the two runs must
 * agree byte for byte on what the backend received, on stdout, and on the exit
 * code.
 *
 * ## What neither layer can see, stated rather than implied
 *
 * - **`scripts/`.** The walk covers `src/` and `bin/` — what ships. A script that
 *   read the ledger would not be caught here.
 * - **A path with no `ledger` in it.** The indirect rule below refuses
 *   `join(…, "ledger", …)` outside the ledger itself; an absolute path typed out
 *   in full, or a segment built by concatenation, is invisible to it.
 * - **Layer B covers `turn` only.** `as`, `soul verify` and every later command
 *   are outside it.
 * - **A new read inside the two allowed files.** `bin/commands/ledger.ts` is
 *   allowed to call `query`; nothing here stops it from putting the result
 *   somewhere it does not belong. That is the residue of allowing a reader at all,
 *   and it is why the allowance records a *verb* per file and not just a name.
