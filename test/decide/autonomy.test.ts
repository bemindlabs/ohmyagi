/**
 * S5.1 — the dial, and the two ways a dial can lie.
 *
 * A dial lies by having no effect. There are exactly two shapes of that here
 * and both have cases below:
 *
 * 1. **A setting nothing reads.** `read` is the honest example — no vendor
 *    offers a flag that permits reading and forbids writing — and the answer is
 *    not to hide the number but to print `not separable` beside it. What is
 *    asserted is that `actLevel` does not include it, so a category with no
 *    mechanism cannot veto turns either.
 * 2. **A setting arithmetic quietly reduces.** `min(write, run, reach)` means
 *    `write = 3` with `reach = 1` does nothing at all, and
 *    `test/decide/effective.test.ts` asserts that every such reduction comes
 *    back as a {@link Clamp} with both numbers in it.
 *
 * And the direction, which every test here is written to keep visible: the dial
 * does not add restraint. Level 1 — the default — is what om-agi did before it
 * existed, because `readOnlyArgs` was spliced into every vendor's argv
 * unconditionally. 2 and 3 are the new thing.
