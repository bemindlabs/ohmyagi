/**
 * The checkers that read source as a syntax tree rather than as text.
 *
 * Two acceptance criteria are now proven by walking an import closure and
 * looking at what is in it — S0.4 AC2 (no path in om-agi pushes) and S3.5 AC2
 * (no path in the observer opens a socket) — and a third, S2.2 AC4, has been
 * doing a weaker version of the same thing since the ledger landed. They lived
 * as three private copies inside three test files, which is how the ledger's
 * copy still matches `"node:net"` as a *string* and would not see
 * `import net from "net"`.
 *
 * So the checkers are here, and the import walk is over the tree as well:
 *
 * - the regular expression the walk used, `/(?:from|import)\s+"(\.[^"]+)"/`,
 *   cannot see `await import("./leak.ts")` or a single-quoted specifier, and a
 *   closure with a hole in it makes every assertion over that closure smaller
 *   than it reads;
 * - a *file* cannot export helpers to another test file without being run as
 *   a test itself, which is why this is `test/support/` and not a `.test.ts`.
 *
 * Every function here is exercised against synthetic source that it must catch
 * and synthetic source it must not — the controls live in the test files that
 * use them, beside the assertion they make meaningful.

 * - `console.error.call(console)` and `.apply`;
 * - a method passed as a value — `lines.forEach(console.error)`;
 * - a `console` that is a local binding rather than the global;
 * - a wrapper that forwards no arguments — `const blank = () => console.error("");`
 *   is fine, but a helper written to call `console.error()` is invisible at
 *   every call site of the helper.
 *
 * The one it is aimed at — somebody typing `console.error()` where a blank line
 * is wanted — is also the only one anybody has typed here.
