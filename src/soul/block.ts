/**
 * The delimited region om-agi owns inside a file somebody else wrote.
 *
 * Every instruction file this command touches already belongs to a human, and
 * often to two or three other tools as well. So om-agi claims one region,
 * marks both ends of it, and treats every byte outside those markers as none
 * of its business. The promise S1.2 AC4 makes — *a human's own writing is not
 * swallowed* — is only as good as this file.
 *
 * Three details carry that promise:
 *
 * - **`lead` and `tail` record what we inserted around the block.** Appending
 *   a block to a file that did not end in a newline means adding newlines that
 *   were not there before. Counting them in the marker is what lets `strip`
 *   hand back the original file byte-for-byte (S1.5 AC1), rather than a file
 *   that is the same except for whitespace nobody asked for.
 * - **`sha256` covers the body between the markers.** If it does not match, a
 *   human edited text inside our region, and the only safe move is to refuse
 *   and say where. Overwriting it would be exactly the failure this file
 *   exists to prevent.
 * - **Markers match whole lines only, exactly.** A file that *talks about* the
 *   marker — a doc, a quoted example indented in a code fence — is not a file
 *   that contains one. When a marker does appear in a shape we cannot read as
 *   "no block" or "one well-formed block", we refuse rather than guess.
