/**
 * The one place om-agi is allowed to start a subprocess.
 *
 * S0.4 AC2 asks for a property — *no path in om-agi pushes* — and a property is
 * only as good as the narrowest place it can be checked. Before this file there
 * were two `Bun.spawn` call sites and no helper between them, and the test that
 * was supposed to guard the first one matched the literal text
 * `Bun.spawn(["…"`, so it could not see the second one at all: `cli-exec.ts`
 * builds its argv at run time and hands over a variable. A gate that reads like
 * a proof and is in fact a grep for one shape of one call is the failure mode
 * this whole story is about.
 *
 * So: every subprocess goes through {@link spawnGuarded}, {@link refusal} is a
 * pure function a test can interrogate directly, and a static check over `src/`
 * and `bin/` asserts that `Bun.spawn` appears in this file and nowhere else.
 * Three layers, each with a control that proves it bites — see
 * `test/guard/no-push.test.ts`.
 *
 * ## What this can and cannot promise
 *
 * It promises that **om-agi's own code has no path that pushes**: `git` may only
 * be invoked with a closed list of local, read-mostly verbs, and the binaries
 * that are the usual way to reach a remote without the word `git` in the argv —
 * shells, `gh`, `ssh`, `rsync` — are refused outright.
 *
 * It does not promise that no push can happen on a machine running om-agi, and
 * nothing here should be read as if it did. `cli-exec` spawns vendor CLIs, and
 * a vendor CLI is an agent with its own shell tool: it can run `git push` inside
 * its own process, and no static check on this repository can see that. That
 * limit is stated in {@link GUARD_LIMITS}, printed by the guard, and written
 * into ADR 0002 — in three places rather than one, because an acceptance
 * criterion that promises more than it proves is worse than one that promises
 * less.

 * - `rev-parse` — where is the hooks directory, and does HEAD exist yet.
 * - `ls-files` — what is in the index before the first commit exists.
 * - `diff` — what is staged, once it does. Always with `--name-only`, which
 *   produces no diff and so never reaches a `diff.external` driver; a repository
 *   can configure one, and that is a command in somebody's own config, not a
 *   remote.
 * - `cat-file` — the staged bytes, which is what a commit will actually keep.
 * - `rev-list` — how many commits are already unreachable by deletion.
 * - `config` — reading remote URLs, and only ever reading (see {@link refusal}).
 *
 * git refuses to let an alias shadow a builtin, so this list cannot be widened
 * by anything in a repository's own config.
