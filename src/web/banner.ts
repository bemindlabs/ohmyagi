/**
 * What `ohmyagi web` prints about its link (D-162).
 *
 * The link carries the page's key after `#t=`, and the key is the whole of the
 * page's lock. At a terminal the person who started the page reads it and it
 * is gone; anywhere else — a systemd service, a pipe, a file — the same line is
 * kept: journald holds stdout and stderr both, and whoever can read the journal
 * (or whatever ships it somewhere) could open the page. So off a terminal the
 * link is printed without its key: with `--key-file`, the file's path is named
 * instead and no key material appears at all; without one, the key is masked to
 * its first and last four characters — enough to tell two keys apart, never
 * enough to use one.
