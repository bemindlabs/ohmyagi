/**
 * The scan rules, and the two things about them that matter more than the list.
 *
 * **Nothing here is a real secret.** Every fixture is assembled from fragments
 * at run time (D-021): a string that looks like a live key, sitting in a
 * repository designed to be opened one day, is the exact mistake this scanner
 * exists to catch. The two numeric fixtures are constructed to satisfy their
 * checksums arithmetically and belong to nobody.
 *
 * **A finding must never carry what it found.** A blocked commit that echoed
 * the token would have put it in terminal scrollback and in whatever the output
 * was piped to, and no `forget` in this project reaches either (D-022). So the
 * last test in this file takes every finding the suite produces and asserts the
 * secret is not in the text a person would see.
