/**
 * The token counts, read off the vendors themselves — opt-in, and the only
 * layer here that can tell you the registry is still true.
 *
 * Run with:
 *
 *     OM_AGI_REAL_USAGE=1 OM_AGI_REAL_MODEL=<ollama model> bun test test/exec/usage.real.test.ts
 *
 * Skipped otherwise, and skipped on purpose. Everything else in this suite
 * measures om-agi against a stub that was written to print what the registry
 * expects, so a suite that is entirely green proves only that om-agi is
 * self-consistent. The claim `registry.ts` actually makes — *these are the
 * fields the vendor prints, on this stream, in this shape* — is a claim about
 * somebody else's program, and it goes stale without anyone touching this repo.
 * Only a real turn can check it.
 *
 * Why it cannot be a gate: each case spends a real turn. It costs quota, it
 * writes a transcript into the operator's own home, and it needs a logged-in
 * CLI — none of which belongs in `bun test`. A backend that is not available is
 * reported and skipped rather than failed, for the same reason.
 *
 * What a failure here means: the vendor moved, and every line om-agi has
 * written since it moved says `missing` where it used to say a number. That is
 * the failure mode the three-state design chose — a visible gap instead of a
 * wrong figure — and this file is how the gap gets noticed.
 *
 * Nothing is written here by name (D-021): the home is whatever the operator's
 * environment says, the model comes from a variable, and no path is spelled out.
