/**
 * `bin/shared.ts` — the one thing in it that can be wrong while everything
 * stays green.
 *
 * `ENGINE_ROOT` is `resolve(import.meta.dir, "..")`, and under
 * `bun build --compile` every module is flattened into the executable, so that
 * expression answers with a path inside a virtual filesystem. Nothing crashes.
 * Nothing is red. `doctor` simply scanned a directory that is not there, read
 * nothing, found nothing, and printed `ok`.
 *
 * {@link checkoutRoot} is the answer, and it is tested here rather than only
 * through the binary because the rule it encodes is worth arguing with on its
 * own: *is the engine's source where this process thinks it is?* — asked as
 * evidence on disk, never as a test on what the virtual path happens to be
 * called. `test/cli/binary.test.ts` is the other half, and builds a real
 * binary to check the answer end to end.
 *
 * ## And the rest of the file, called rather than spawned
 *
 * Everything else here is a function that takes values and returns them, and
 * every one of them was reached only through `Bun.spawn` of the CLI — which
 * bun does not measure, so `bin/shared.ts` read 29.21% while eight commands
 * leaned on it. {@link parseArgs} is the one that most deserves its own test:
 * its `booleans` list exists because `--apply ./soul` without it swallows the
 * directory into the flag and the positional vanishes silently, and "silently"
 * is not something a spawned end-to-end test notices either.
