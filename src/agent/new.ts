/**
 * Making an agent: a directory, five files, and `git init`. Nothing else.
 *
 * What this function does *not* do is most of its design. It does not commit,
 * does not add a remote, does not push, and does not offer a flag that would.
 * Publishing an identity is a human act (D-013), and the way to keep that true
 * is for the code path not to exist. S0.4 now checks that omission rather than
 * trusting it: `git init` goes through `src/spawn.ts`, whose verb allowlist has
 * no way to reach a remote, and `test/guard/no-push.test.ts` proves it three
 * ways. The first commit is therefore the owner's to make, which also means the
 * owner is the one who decides what the repository says on the day it starts
 * remembering.
 *
 * Since S0.4 the repository also gets its guard here, in the same breath as
 * `git init`. A pre-commit scan somebody has to remember to install is a scan
 * that is not installed on the day it would have mattered; and because
 * `.git/hooks` is not cloned, `ohmyagi guard install` exists for the clone on
 * the other machine. A repository whose hooks could not be written is reported
 * as `incomplete`, exactly like one `git init` failed in: the files are correct
 * and om-agi will not delete them, but it will not pretend the guard is there.
 *
 * Three destinations are refused outright, each because of what it would do to
 * an invariant rather than because it would be untidy:
 *
 * - **Inside the engine's own repository.** The engine carries no identity data
 *   at all (D-021); a soul written under it is a soul one `git add` away from
 *   a repository that is designed to be opened to the public one day. This one
 *   needs an {@link NewAgentRequest.engineRoot} to compare against, and the
 *   compiled binary has none — see the note on that field for what holds
 *   instead, and for what does not.
 * - **Inside any other git repository.** An agent is its own repository or it
 *   is not portable, and a soul committed into somebody else's history cannot
 *   be withdrawn from it afterwards (I-4).
 * - **A directory that already has anything in it.** There is no merge here
 *   that could be got right, and the file this would overwrite is the one
 *   somebody would most want back.
 *
 * `git init` runs through a seam rather than directly so that a test can watch
 * what happens when it fails without breaking git on the machine. When it does
 * fail the files are left where they are and said so: they are correct, they
 * are simply not a repository yet, and deleting somebody's new agent to tidy up
 * after a failed subprocess would be the worse of the two outcomes.
