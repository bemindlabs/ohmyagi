/**
 * What a turn carries from memory, and how much (S4.3, D-039).
 *
 * Pure. `bin/commands/turn.ts` asks {@link recall} and hands the hits here;
 * this decides which of them fit under the ceiling and writes the block that
 * goes into the system prompt beside the soul.
 *
 * ## Why the system prompt and not the prompt
 *
 * The prompt is what the owner typed, and the ledger records it verbatim
 * (S2.2). Splicing recalled text into it would make every ledger line a
 * mixture of what was said and what om-agi added. The soul's hash is still
 * taken from the soul alone, so a ledger line keeps naming which *soul* was
 * worn rather than which soul-plus-this-turn's-memory.
 *
 * ## Whole pieces or none
 *
 * A piece that does not fit is skipped, not cut. Half a note reads as a whole
 * one to the model, and the half that was dropped may be the half that said
 * "this was wrong". A smaller piece further down the list may still fit, so
 * the walk continues rather than stopping at the first miss.
