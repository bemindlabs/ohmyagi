/**
 * Proof that the dial was consulted before a turn was composed — checked by
 * `tsc`, not by a reviewer.
 *
 * ## Why a brand and not a number
 *
 * {@link import("../decide/autonomy.ts")} explains the thing everybody gets
 * backwards: today, every vendor's read-only flag goes onto every turn
 * unconditionally, so the dial is what **removes** it. That makes "did anything
 * ask the dial?" the question worth being unable to skip. A plain
 * `level: number` on `TurnRequest` would have been skippable in the ordinary
 * way — somebody passes `3` from a config, or `2` from a test, or leaves the
 * field out and a default fills it in, and the loosening happens with nothing in
 * review to catch the eye.
 *
 * So a {@link Restraint} can only be made by {@link restrain}, which takes an
 * {@link EffectiveDial} — and an `EffectiveDial` can only be made by
 * {@link effectiveDial}, which is where the minimum, the environment ceiling and
 * the stop flag are applied. The chain is: file → ceilings → minimum → brand →
 * argv. There is no shortcut into the middle of it that type-checks.
 *
 * Same shape, and for the same reason, as `CaptureNotice`
 * (`src/observer/store.ts`) and `EgressNotice` (`src/exec/egress.ts`): one
 * constructor, plus an AST gate (`test/decide/restraint.test.ts`) that refuses
 * `as Restraint` anywhere but here, because a cast would switch the whole
 * mechanism off in one keystroke.
 *
 * ## The vendor with no mechanism is refused, not run hopefully
 *
 * A vendor may declare `readOnly.kind: "none"` with `evidence: "writes"` —
 * measured, a headless turn told to write a file wrote it. kimi did until
 * S12.6 found it a profile file (D-120); none does today. Before this file, a
 * turn on such a vendor at any level ran exactly the same way: there was no flag
 * to add and nothing said so out loud. That is the dial lying by omission — the
 * owner sets a level, and one path through the program ignores it silently.
 *
 * {@link restraintRefusal} closes it: at an acting level of 1, a vendor with no
 * mechanism is **refused**, and the refusal quotes `readOnly.why` word for word
 * rather than paraphrasing it, so there is one sentence about that hole in this
 * program and not two that can drift apart.
 *
 * At level 0 every vendor is refused, which is what level 0 means.
