/**
 * The record that om-agi wrote a subject's vectors somewhere — so that `erase`
 * knows where to look, and knows when it must not certify.
 *
 * A vector collection lives in another program's storage. When that program is
 * down, "I asked and it was not there" and "I could not ask" look the same from
 * the outside, and only the second one may still hold the subject's text. So
 * {@link indexAgent}'s vector half writes this file **before** it creates the
 * collection: if the file exists, a collection may exist, and an `erase` that
 * cannot reach the store refuses rather than certifying over it.
 *
 * It lives under the state root, per subject, and `erase` removes it as a tree
 * of the `rag` place — the file names the subject, and AC3 searches the state
 * root for the subject afterwards.
