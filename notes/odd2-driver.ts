/**
 * odd2 — the probes that cannot live inside `bun test`.
 *
 *     npm exec -- bun run notes/odd2-driver.ts
 *
 * Everything in `test/odd2/free-pass.test.ts` is a function call or one short
 * CLI run. The questions here are a different kind: *what does a guard say when
 * the thing it guards has been taken away?* Answering that means running `bun
 * test` — and a test that starts `bun test` is how this repository once got a
 * fork bomb, so G4-3 keeps those out of the suite and puts them here instead.
 *
 * ## The real tree is never touched
 *
 * Every run below happens in a `mkdtemp` copy built from `git ls-files`, with
 * `node_modules` symlinked in. The mutation is applied to the **copy**. The
 * checkout this is run from is read and never written, so a driver killed
 * half-way leaves no mutation on disk — which is a thing that has happened here
 * before, and is the reason it is written down.
 *
 * ## The driver's own controls
 *
 * A driver that hunts checks which pass without looking must not be one. So:
 *
 *  - an **unmutated** copy must run the same test green, with a test count
 *    above zero;
 *  - the **mutated** copy must turn that same file red, which is what proves
 *    the mutation reaches the assertions rather than merely breaking an import;
 *  - every run is parsed for `Ran N tests`. **N = 0 is a driver failure**, not
 *    a green run — a suite that matched no file is the free pass this whole
 *    task is about, and it is the one shape a runner reports as success.
 *
 * The driver exits 1 if any control does not behave, or if any run executed no
 * tests where tests were expected. A row whose result differs from the
 * prediction registered beside it is printed as a miss and is not a failure:
 * the predictions were written before anything was measured, and some of them
 * are wrong. `notes/odd2-free-pass-survey.md` records which.
