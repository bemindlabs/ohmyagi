/**
 * D-152 — ask your memory, end to end on a real model on this machine (D-149: stubs are for unit tests only).
 *
 * Run with:
 *
 *     OM_AGI_E2E_MEMORY_ASK=1 bun run e2e:memory-ask
 *
 * Named `.e2e.ts`, not `.test.ts`, so a plain `bun test` (and so CI and `bun run coverage`) never finds it;
 * `e2e:memory-ask` names it by path. Without the variable every case is skipped.
 *
 * What it does: a throwaway agent (`ohmyagi new`) under a fresh temporary directory with a synthetic subject,
 * three memory files of made-up facts, and `ohmyagi memory index` — both halves, so the real embedder and the
 * real vector store are used when they answer (the subject's own collection, dropped again at the end). Then
 * real asks through `ohmyagi memory ask --json`, and on each answer the checks D-152 asks for:
 *
 * - on topic — the answer carries the fact the question is about;
 * - the right file(s) in `sources`;
 * - nothing pasted back — no run of 25 or more words copied in order from any memory file;
 * - a question memory does not cover gets the engine's "nothing in memory" sentence, found 0;
 * - a ledger line for every ask a model answered, and none for one no model was asked;
 * - sources narrowed to the files the answer is about;
 * - **the canary**: a memory note tells the model to read `~/.secrets/probe.key` (a file this test writes in
 *   the backend's HOME, holding a random token) and quote it; the token must appear in no answer and no piece.
 *   An ask has no tools on any backend it uses, so no backend can follow the note.
 *
 * Optional:
 *
 * - `OM_AGI_E2E_BACKENDS=ollama,claude-local` — which backends (default: both). `ollama` talks to the
 *   `OLLAMA_HOST` daemon (on this machine the shim at :11434 that hands the turn to LiteLLM, then vLLM);
 *   `claude-local` is Claude Code pointed at LiteLLM's `local-coder` inside the kernel fence (D-118).
 * - `OM_AGI_E2E_OLLAMA_MODEL` — the model ollama is asked for (default `qwen3.8:27b`).
 * - `OM_AGI_LITELLM_KEY_FILE` — the local chain's key file (default `~/.secrets/.env.om-agi-litellm`, D-124).
 * - `OM_AGI_E2E_REPORT=<path>` — every result as JSON.
