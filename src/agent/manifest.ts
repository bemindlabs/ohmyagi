/**
 * `.dagi/manifest.json` — what was built, from what, by which engine, and when.
 *
 * AC6 asks for a record of "what was made from what, when", and AC7 asks for a
 * rebuild to come out the same. Those pull in opposite directions, and this
 * file is where that is resolved rather than fudged: **`built_at` is the only
 * field allowed to change between two rebuilds of an unchanged repository.**
 * Everything else — the schema tag, the subject, the generator, every artefact
 * path and hash, every source path and hash — is a function of what git holds.
 * The test does not skip `built_at`; it asserts that it is the only line that
 * moved, which is the difference between a promise and a claim.
 *
 * The alternative considered was dating the build from the source commit, which
 * would make the file identical across rebuilds. It was not chosen because it
 * is wrong exactly when it matters: a working tree with uncommitted edits would
 * be dated by a commit that does not contain them.
 *
 * **Every path in here is relative to the repository** (AC5). An absolute path
 * would name the machine that happened to run the build, survive a `git clone`
 * into a container where it means nothing, and hand a reader of a private repo
 * a fact about somebody's home directory (D-021).
