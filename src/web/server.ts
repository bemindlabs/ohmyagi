/**
 * `ohmyagi web` — the HTTP side (D-060). A page on this machine that a person
 * uses instead of typing commands, and that can do only what those commands
 * can do.
 *
 * Every action is the CLI run as a child (`turn`, `proposal decide`, `proposal
 * triage`, `stop`), handed in as `run` — so the page gets the same refusals,
 * notices and records as the terminal, and no second way to do anything. What
 * stays in the terminal on purpose: raising a category to 3, consenting to
 * capture, releasing the brake, erase. Each needs a phrase typed by the person
 * it concerns, and a button would be the easy path around that.
 *
 * Guarded three ways, because a server on 127.0.0.1 is reachable from any page
 * the same browser opens: a random token in the URL, sent back on every call
 * in a header a cross-site form cannot set; a Host check against DNS
 * rebinding; and loopback by default.
