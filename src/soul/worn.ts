/**
 * Which identity this machine is wearing — read off the bytes, never remembered.
 *
 * D-011 made om-agi a runtime that *wears* identities rather than one that has
 * one, and the first thing that follows from it is a question somebody has to
 * be able to ask out loud: **which one is on right now?** S0.2 AC5 asks
 * `doctor` for it and S1.6 AC1 asks the switch for it; this is the one function
 * both of them call, so that there is one answer rather than two that drift.
 *
 * Three decisions, each of which is the difference between a report and a
 * guess:
 *
 * - **Derived, never stored.** There is deliberately no "currently worn" file,
 *   no pointer under the state root, nothing to go stale. The worn identity is
 *   whatever the marker in each vendor's instruction file says it is, read
 *   fresh. A stored pointer would be right until something else wrote the file,
 *   and it would keep being confident afterwards — which is exactly the silent
 *   failure this project exists to catch.
 * - **Mixed is a verdict, not an average.** A's block in one file and B's in
 *   another is neither "wearing A" nor "wearing B": it is a half-finished
 *   switch, and it is the shape a memory leak across identities (I-3) takes on
 *   disk. So it gets its own verdict, and {@link residue} names the files that
 *   still carry the identity that was supposed to be gone (AC3).
 * - **Backends with no file are reported as such, not as "nothing worn".**
 *   `ollama` has no instruction file at any scope; its identity arrives in the
 *   system field of each request and is gone when the request is. This function
 *   cannot see that channel and says so rather than counting it as empty.
 *
 * Read-only: `Bun.file().text()` and nothing else. Asking what is worn must
 * never be the thing that creates or changes it.
