/**
 * The hand that keeps working when the first one is gone.
 *
 * A fallback belongs in the engine rather than in a shell wrapper for one
 * reason: the decision it has to make is *what counts as a failure worth
 * retrying*, and that judgement is the same judgement `verify` makes. A CLI
 * that exits 0 with nothing to show is the case a shell `||` cannot see, and
 * it is exactly the case a fallback must catch.
 *
 * This is also the file S2.1 AC6 rests on — take `claude` and `codex` off
 * PATH and the turn still has to finish on a local model alone (I-1). It
 * lives on its own rather than inside the barrel so the coverage gate can see
 * it: ninety lines of decision-making hidden behind an exemption that said
 * "re-export barrel" was untrue, and untested.
