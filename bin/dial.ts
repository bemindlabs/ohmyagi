/**
 * What `turn`, `autonomy` and `stop` all need to know about the dial.
 *
 * Here rather than in one of them for the reason `bin/shared.ts` states: three
 * callers in three files. It is a second module beside `shared.ts` rather than
 * more of it, because everything here is about one subject — the autonomy dial —
 * and `shared.ts` is already the file every task has to open.
 *
 * ## What is here and what is not
 *
 * Reading, deciding and writing are here, because every one of them can be
 * called from a test with a temporary directory. **Printing is not**, and the
 * split is the coverage gate's rather than an aesthetic one: this file is under
 * `bin/` and not in `SPAWN_ONLY`, so it is held to the 85% line coverage floor,
 * and a page of report-writing that only ever runs in a spawned process would
 * push it under and earn it an exemption it has not earned. `sayDial` lives in
 * `bin/commands/autonomy.ts`, which is spawn-only and honestly so.
 *
 * ## The sentence this module exists to keep in front of people
 *
 * The dial does not add safety; it is what takes safety off. Every vendor's
 * read-only flag already goes onto every turn, unconditionally, and has since
 * before E5 (`src/exec/registry.ts`). Level 1 — the default, AC3 — is that
 * behaviour exactly. Levels 2 and 3 are the new thing, and what they do is
 * *remove* the flag. A reader who meets something called an autonomy dial will
 * assume the opposite and will be wrong in the expensive direction, so every
 * report built on this module says which way it points.
