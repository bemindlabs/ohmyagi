/**
 * `ohmyagi usage` — what the agent's turns used and cost, signed with its own key (S15.4 minimum, S15.8,
 * S15.9, D-106, D-110).
 *
 *   report <dir> --subject <id>   one row per model delivery from the ledger, signed; --json prints the envelope;
 *                                 --market and --listing (and --job) bind it to where it is going (D-141)
 *   verify <file|-> --key <pk>    check a signed report against the key it should be signed by, and with
 *                                 --market and --listing, against where it should be going
 *   prices [--json]               the price tables a turn is charged against now: shipped, and the owner's
 *
 * The parts are in `src/identity/` (sign, key, report, strict-json), where tests call them; this is the
 * parsing and the printing. A report never holds what was said — no prompt, no answer, no memory, no subject
 * id — and a count the ledger does not have is null, never 0. Everything printed from a report goes through
 * `printable` first: a report is somebody else's text on your terminal (S15.8 review, M2).
 *
 * `verify` exits 0 only for a well-formed usage report signed by exactly the key given with `--key` (review
 * L4): 1 is not valid, 2 a command line it will not run, and 3 a report that is internally consistent but was
 * checked against no key — which says only that *some* key signed it, and anyone can make a key. With
 * `--market` and `--listing` a report bound anywhere else, or to nothing, is not valid (1); without them the
 * binding is printed and said to be unchecked, and the exit code is what it was.
