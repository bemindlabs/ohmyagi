/**
 * The proposal store — where it is, what it compares, and what it refuses.
 *
 * Four things are asked here that nothing else can ask:
 *
 * 1. **The address is under `personal/`,** which is what makes `ohmyagi erase`
 *    reach it. D-029 required that to be *measured* rather than assumed, and it
 *    is measured in two places: the containment of the path here, and the
 *    canary in `test/erase/plan.test.ts` that is gone after a real erase while a
 *    control file outside `personal/` is not. A sixth `PlaceId` would have made
 *    `tsc` enforce registration; this store is inside an existing place on
 *    purpose (D-025), so the enforcement is here instead.
 * 2. **Nothing on this path can reach a network or start a process.** The store
 *    holds free text about what the owner does, which makes it the most valuable
 *    thing in the engine to anything that wanted to send data somewhere (I-6).
 * 3. **The key table.** The comparison is exact, so the pairs that are equal and
 *    the pairs that are not are written down — including the one that is the
 *    known hole, so nobody has to discover it in production.
 * 4. **A decision is written once.** Overwriting a recorded "no" would leave no
 *    trace that the question had ever been answered differently.
