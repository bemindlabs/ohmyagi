/**
 * "soul" is three locations on this machine, not one — and finding that out is
 * most of what this file is for.
 *
 * `ohmyagi soul apply` puts an identity in more places than the directory it was
 * read from, and an erase that only removed `<agent>/soul/` would leave two
 * working copies of the thing somebody just asked to have deleted:
 *
 * 1. **`<agent>/soul/` in git**, plus the derived `<agent>/.dagi/`, which holds
 *    `soul/rendered.md` — the exact text a model was told.
 * 2. **om-agi's block inside every vendor instruction file** `apply` wrote to.
 *    Those are somebody else's files: the block is delimited, and removing it
 *    is {@link strip}'s job, never a rewrite of the file.
 * 3. **`$XDG_STATE_HOME/om-agi/backups/<subject>/`** — the originals `apply`
 *    copies before each write. This is the one that is easy to miss and the
 *    worst to leave: a backup taken before the *second* apply contains the
 *    block written by the first, so the backup tree holds old copies of the
 *    identity that om-agi itself created.
 *
 * ## Which blocks are this subject's
 *
 * Only the ones whose opening marker says `subject=<this id>` (I-3). Another
 * identity's block in the same file is left byte-identical, and the report says
 * it was found and left. A block whose body was edited by hand makes
 * {@link strip} refuse, and the refusal is the whole run's refusal: the backups
 * stay where they are and nothing is certified, because a half-erased identity
 * with a truthful-looking exit code is worse than a stopped one.
 *
 * ## Where the file list comes from
 *
 * The union of two sources, and it has to be both. The caller passes the paths
 * the vendor registry resolves *now*; this file adds every `files[].path` from
 * every backup manifest, because a CLI that has since been uninstalled is a CLI
 * whose instruction file still sits on disk with the block in it, and the
 * registry-driven list would not mention it.
 *
 * ## No second deleter
 *
 * {@link strip} is `soul apply`'s own inverse and S1.5 `soul revoke` is
 * specified to reuse it (ADR 0002). This file calls it and does not reimplement
 * it, and it does **not** do S1.5's other half: no backup is restored, nothing
 * is verified against a manifest hash. Erase removes; revoke puts back.
