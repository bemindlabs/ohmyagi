/**
 * The brake — layer one of three, and the only one that needs no code of ours.
 *
 * S5.4 AC2 asks that the kill switch work *even when the main agent is stuck*,
 * which rules out anything that has to be delivered by the process being
 * stopped. So "stopped" is the **existence of a file**, and nothing more:
 *
 * ```
 * touch "$XDG_STATE_HOME/om-agi/STOP"      # or ~/.local/state/om-agi/STOP
 * ```
 *
 * The contents are never read, never parsed, and never will be. A format is a
 * thing that can be malformed, and a brake that can be malformed is a brake with
 * a failure mode. `stat` succeeds or it does not.
 *
 * ## The three layers, and which of them depend on om-agi
 *
 * | layer | how | depends on |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | 1 · do not start the next one | `touch <stateRoot>/STOP` | the filesystem |
 * | 2 · end the ones running | `ohmyagi stop` | a *new* om-agi process |
 * | 3 · what layer 2 could not reach | `kill -TERM -<pgid>`, with the number printed for you | the shell and the kernel |
 *
 * Layers 1 and 3 need nothing from the program that is misbehaving. Layer 2 is
 * a convenience built on top of them, not the lifeline — which is what makes it
 * acceptable for it to be the one layer that runs our code.
 *
 * ## Why this file is not in git
 *
 * The dial lives in the agent's repository, where `git diff` can show a level
 * change and a clone carries the owner's intent with it. This file must not,
 * and the reason is stronger than a dirty working tree: committed, it would
 * travel with every clone, and a machine that was never told to stop would find
 * itself stopped with nobody there able to say why. A brake is a fact about
 * *this machine now*. The state root is where facts about this machine live.
 *
 * ## Setting it is easy; clearing it is not
 *
 * `touch` sets it. Clearing it is `ohmyagi autonomy resume`, which asks for a
 * phrase typed at a terminal and has no `--yes` — the same shape, and the same
 * reason, as `observe enable`: a program running as the owner can pass a flag
 * on the owner's behalf, and this is one of the few decisions that must cost a
 * human a keystroke. `rm` still works, of course, and saying so is the point:
 * om-agi does not pretend to own a file it cannot defend.
