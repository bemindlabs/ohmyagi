/**
 * The two factories in `src/exec/index.ts`.
 *
 * This file exists because the exemption did not deserve to. `index.ts` sat in
 * the coverage gate's list as a "re-export barrel" while holding `backend()`
 * and `allBackends()` — the two functions that decide, for every command om-agi
 * has, which class a backend id becomes. The file's own header already admitted
 * it ("Two factories and the re-exports"), and the gate could not see the
 * contradiction because it only asks whether a file was *loaded*.
 *
 * The cases were partly covered from `fallback.test.ts`, as a note that the
 * exemption was only honest if what remained got exercised. They live here now,
 * where the file they test is named, and go further: a factory that built the
 * right *class* while dropping the options it was handed would have passed the
 * old version of these.
