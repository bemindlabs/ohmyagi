/**
 * A `git` that writes down every argv it is given, and refuses to touch a
 * network.
 *
 * S0.4 AC2's static checks say om-agi's source cannot reach a remote. This is
 * the layer that watches what actually ran, which is the only one that can
 * catch a push arriving by a route nobody wrote down — a helper invoked with a
 * name that is not `git`, a command built from data, a library doing it on the
 * engine's behalf.
 *
 * The reason the behavioural layer is worth anything at all is `dependencies`
 * being empty, which the static layer pins: with no libgit in the tree, there
 * is no way to write a remote ref except by executing the `git` binary — and
 * the binary the child finds is this script, because it is first on a PATH that
 * holds nothing else.
 *
 * The trap exits 97 on a network verb rather than running it, so a test that
 * regresses fails instead of reaching whatever the argv named. Everything else
 * is handed to the real git, because the commands under test have to actually
 * work: a trap that broke `git init` would make the whole run pass for the
 * wrong reason.
