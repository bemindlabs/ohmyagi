/**
 * The shape of `bin/`, asserted rather than left as an intention.
 *
 * The CLI was one 3364-line file. Almost every task had to open it, so two
 * tasks running in parallel edited the same file and merged by hand — which is
 * a place a change gets lost without anything going red. It is now one file per
 * command, and the property that makes that worth having is not "there are more
 * files" but:
 *
 * - **changing one command touches one file**, which stops being true the
 *   moment one command imports another;
 * - **nothing imports the entry point**, so `main` stays a leaf and no command
 *   can reach the dispatcher it is dispatched from;
 * - **no file is orphaned**, because a half-finished move leaves a file that
 *   still compiles, still passes `tsc`, and is dead.
 *
 * None of those three is visible to the test suite any other way: a dead file
 * or a sideways import changes no output at all. So they are checked here, on
 * the import graph, with controls that the checker can see an import in the
 * first place.
 *
 * A fourth property joined them, and it is the same shape — a fact about which
 * file says a thing, invisible in every output: **the flag list `--as` parses a
 * command line with is the command's own list**, not a copy of it kept in step
 * by hand. That copy existed, and the two halves happened to agree.
 *
 * `bin/shared.ts` gets a check of its own. It holds `ENGINE_ROOT`, which is
 * `resolve(import.meta.dir, "..")` — an expression whose answer depends on
 * which directory the file is in. Moving it one level down into
 * `bin/commands/` would silently point the engine root at `bin/`, and every
 * D-021 check that reads it would go on passing while looking at the wrong
 * tree.
