// Recording, and D-153's always-pause list, for every page the MCP server opens
// (D-151) — independent of what the model asks for.
//
// Recording:
// - a Playwright trace per browser context, named per context, started with
//   `live: true` so the action log, DOM snapshots, screencast frames and
//   network log are written as they happen and survive a `docker kill`;
// - a full-page screenshot after every load, in <out>/screens.
//
// Sensitive actions (src/decide/sensitive.ts, bundled here as sensitive.cjs):
// before Playwright touches an element — click, type/fill, press, check,
// select, upload — or the keyboard types into the focused element, the action
// is described — read through CDP in an isolated world, never in the page's
// own JavaScript (cdp-read.cjs; describe.cjs: kind, the element's role and accessible text,
// the kind of value being typed — never the value — the form it is in and
// where it goes) and handed to `classifyAction`. Paying, sending, deleting,
// credentials, accepting terms, and anything that commits a form without
// saying what it is: **held**, and recorded in <out>/held.jsonl with the
// kind, the rule ids and the reasons, never a value. An element that cannot
// be described is held too (the list errs towards stopping).
//
// What a held action does next (D-156, release.cjs): in a container started
// for a task (OM_AGI_APPROVAL_WAIT > 0 and the task's release public key), it pauses
// and waits for the owner's answer to that exact action, and goes ahead once
// on a yes. A no, an answer that does not verify, or no answer in time: it does
// not happen, and the model is told which. A credential is never released
// (D-160). In a container started by hand there is nobody to ask: refused at
// once. After a yes the element — or, for keystrokes, the focused element — is
// described again; if anything about it changed, it is not the action that was
// approved, and it does not happen.
//
// Dialogs (re-review of PR #19, round 3): accepting a page's `confirm` or
// `prompt` is an action too, classified like any other step:
// - `confirm` (and any type this file does not know): a `submit` whose text is
//   the message — held at every level;
// - `prompt`: typing into a field labelled with the message, its value class
//   inferred from the message — held when the list flags it;
// - `alert` and `beforeunload`: allowed.
// A held dialog is dismissed (always allowed) so the page is not left wedged.
// D-159: a confirm held right after a released action on the same page names
// that action (`follows`), so the owner sees the two as a pair.
//
// Navigation (defence in depth behind the guard's URL check): `page.goto` is
// refused for anything but http:, https: and about:blank.
//
// If anything is ever typed into a password field anyway, that context's
// trace is stopped first and not restarted.
//
// Files are 600 and directories 700: the entrypoint's umask, and modes here.
// Paths and the key file can be pointed elsewhere by the environment, which is
// how test/browser/record.test.ts runs this file in Bun against a fake page.
