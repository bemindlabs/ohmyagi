/**
 * S3.5 AC1 and AC3 — one address, and a delete that proves itself.
 *
 * ## AC1: the address, and why it is this one (D-025)
 *
 * D-014 put observer data under `.dagi/observer/`, on the understanding that
 * E3 could mine it back out of vendor transcripts. SP-1 measured the retention
 * and D-024 changed the epic: capture now happens at the moment something
 * happens, and the capture is the only copy there will ever be. `.dagi/` holds
 * what a rebuild can reconstruct and a rebuild *sweeps out* the rest —
 * `test/agent/rebuild.test.ts` has asserted since S0.3 that it deletes
 * `.dagi/observer/raw.jsonl` by name. Git is not the answer either: a record of
 * what a person did is the most withdrawable thing om-agi will ever hold (I-4),
 * and git remembers what it was asked to forget.
 *
 * So: `personalDir(subject)/observer/`, and nowhere else. Building on
 * `personalDir` rather than beside it is what makes three properties free
 * instead of re-implemented — refused inside a git repository, blocked by the
 * pre-commit scan if staged, created 0700 — and the tests for those live in
 * `test/guard/personal.test.ts`. What is re-checked here is only that the
 * observer directory really is *under* that path, so a later edit cannot quietly
 * move it out from behind them.
 *
 * ## AC3: "purge deletes everything and verification finds nothing"
 *
 * The number a purge prints is read back **off the filesystem after the
 * unlinks**, never derived from how many of them returned successfully. That
 * distinction is the whole criterion: a command that subtracted its own
 * successes from its own plan would print `0 remaining` on a run where a file
 * it never managed to delete is still sitting on disk. So there is a control
 * for exactly that — a file inside a directory this test makes unwritable,
 * which the purge cannot remove and must therefore refuse to report as gone.
 *
 * The other half of I-4 is the half usually skipped: *do not claim to delete
 * what cannot be deleted*. `OBSERVER_UNDELETABLE` is printed on every run
 * including a dry run and a run that found nothing, and the tests at the bottom
 * are what make that "every" checkable.
