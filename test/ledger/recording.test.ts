/**
 * The wrapper that turns a delivered prompt into a line.
 *
 * The property worth testing is not "a turn is recorded" — it is **which**
 * turns are. A backend the chain decided was unavailable never saw the text
 * and must leave no line; a backend that was asked and went silent did see it
 * and must leave one. Getting that backwards would make the ledger answer the
 * question "which backend answered?" when the question I-6 asks is "which
 * backend received this?".
 *
 * The fallback case is exercised with the real `FallbackExec` rather than a
 * mock of one, because the whole claim is about how the two compose.
