/**
 * claude's hook payload → om-agi's record. The door D-024 exists for.
 *
 * ## Measured, not remembered
 *
 * Every field name below was read off the installed binary
 * (`~/.local/share/claude/versions/2.1.278`) rather than recalled, and the same
 * reading is written into `docs/cli-matrix.md` beside the version it came from,
 * next to the usage table that was measured the same way. The rule is the one
 * that table already states: these things move between releases, and when they
 * move the failures are silent.
 *
 * What the reading settled, and what it changed in the plan:
 *
 * - The fields on every payload are `session_id`, `transcript_path`, `cwd`, and
 *   optionally `prompt_id`, `permission_mode`, `agent_id`, `agent_type`,
 *   `effort`. **There is no timestamp**, which is why `at` is an argument here:
 *   the clock at the moment the hook fires is the time of the action.
 * - `UserPromptSubmit` carries `prompt` and an optional `source` — the vendor's
 *   own word for who authored the turn. This is far better evidence than w4's
 *   plan expected to have, and `origin.ts` explains exactly how far it goes.
 * - `PostToolUse` carries `tool_name`, `tool_input`, `tool_response`,
 *   `tool_use_id`, and optionally `duration_ms` and `mcp_server`.
 * - **A tool that fails does not fire `PostToolUse` at all.** It fires
 *   `PostToolUseFailure`, with `error` instead of `tool_response`. A denied
 *   permission fires `PermissionDenied`. The plan for w4 asked only for
 *   `UserPromptSubmit` and `PostToolUse`, which would have recorded a world in
 *   which nothing the owner does ever fails — and `outcome` would have been a
 *   column of `ok` that meant "this reader cannot see failures". So the
 *   failure event is read too, and the snippet asks for it.
 *
 * `PreToolUse` is still not asked for. It runs before every tool call and adds
 * latency to all of them, it cannot know the outcome, and the owner already has
 * a hook on that event.
 *
 * ## What this adapter refuses to carry
 *
 * `prompt` is present in the payload and is never read. `tool_response` is
 * present and is never read except to decide `ok` (and it is not even needed
 * for that — the event name says it). `S3.1 AC5` is "metadata and event, not a
 * copy of the transcript", and this is the one place where keeping the copy
 * would have been a single field access.

 * a program that wired itself in would have made the consent this directory
 * asks for a formality. So this returns a string, and what happens to it is
 * somebody else's decision: paste it into `settings.json`, or hand it to
 * `claude --settings "$(…)"` for one session and change no file at all —
 * measured on 2.1.278, that flag takes "a settings JSON file or a JSON string".
 *
 * The matcher is omitted rather than set to `"*"`: the field is optional in the
 * schema and an absent one means every tool, which is what this wants, and
 * guessing at the wildcard's spelling would be a guess with a silent failure
 * mode — a hook that matches nothing looks exactly like a hook that is working.
