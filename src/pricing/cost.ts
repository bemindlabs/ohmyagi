/**
 * What one turn cost, from what the backend counted and the price table in force — or why it is not charged
 * (S15.9, D-110, D-139).
 *
 * Pure arithmetic over integers, in one direction: counts × rates → micro-dollars. Nothing here estimates.
 * A turn is charged only when every number the sum needs is one the backend printed and one a table named;
 * otherwise it is **not charged**, with the reason, because D-110 bills a turn with no count at nothing — the
 * hirer never pays for a guess, and the agent's owner is the one with a reason to make the adapter report.
 *
 * ## The formula, so anyone can check it without om-agi
 *
 *     uncached = input − (cache_read ?? 0) − (cache_write ?? 0)
 *     write1h  = cache_write_1h ?? 0                     (the part of cache_write written to the 1-hour cache)
 *     sum      = uncached × rate.input + cache_read × rate.cache_read
 *              + (cache_write − write1h) × rate.cache_write + write1h × rate.cache_write_1h
 *              + output × rate.output                                       (rates: µ$ per million tokens)
 *     cost     = (sum + 500000) // 1000000                                   (µ$, halves rounded up)
 *
 * `input` is the whole prompt side and the cache counts are parts of it (see `Usage`). A cache count is null
 * on a charged turn only when the backend never prints one (`not_printed`); then there is no part to take out
 * and none to price. A part whose count is above zero needs a rate — a null rate for a part this turn used
 * is a price nobody named, and the turn is not charged. One rounding per turn, after the sum, so a total over
 * rows is the plain sum of the rows' costs. BigInt inside, because tokens × rate can pass 2^53.
 *
 * ## A cache write is two prices (D-143)
 *
 * Anthropic prices a write to the 5-minute cache at 1.25× input and one to the 1-hour cache at 2×, and claude
 * says which it wrote (`usage.cache_creation`). The 1-hour part is priced at `cache_write_1h`, the rest of the
 * write at `cache_write`. With `write1h` 0 the sum is the formula before D-143 term for term, which is why a
 * row with no 1-hour write keeps the shape it had. A backend that never splits its writes (grok, ollama) has
 * `write1h` 0: its writes are one part at one rate, as before.
 *
 * A turn whose backend prints the split and did not print it this time, and which wrote to the cache, is not
 * charged (`usage-unsplit`) — not priced at the 5-minute rate as the lower bound. D-110 and D-139 bill what is
 * known and nothing that is not: the 5-minute rate would be a guess about which cache was written, and a guess
 * that can only fall one way is still a guess the hirer pays for. The owner, not the hirer, is the one who can
 * make the backend say (by running a CLI that prints the split).

/**
 * Why a turn is not charged. The order is the order they are checked in, so a turn gets the most basic

 *
 * - `not-recorded` — the line was written before om-agi priced turns (S15.9). Nothing is priced after the
 *   fact: the table in force then is not known now.
 * - `usage-missing` — the backend printed no count this turn, or nobody has surveyed what it prints (D-110).
 * - `usage-unsplit` — there are counts, but not input and output apart (codex prints one total), or the cache
 *   parts are more than the input they are part of, or the turn wrote to the cache on a backend that says
 *   which cache it wrote and this time did not say (D-143).
 * - `model-unknown` — the line names no model the price can be looked up by: the backend ran its own default and
 *   did not say which, or it named more than one, or it was asked for an alias no table lists (D-142).
 * - `table-unusable` — the owner's price file is there and cannot be used; nothing is priced until it can.
 * - `price-unknown` — no table in force prices this model on this backend, or none prices a part this turn
 *   used, or the figure is too large for a signed report to hold.
