/**
 * What a turn cost, or why it is not charged (S15.9, D-110, D-139).
 *
 * The formula is small enough to state in a comment and important enough to pin with numbers a person can
 * redo by hand: counts × rates in micro-dollars per million tokens, one rounding, halves up. The reasons are
 * pinned one by one, because each is a turn a hirer is not billed for — and the order matters: a turn gets
 * the most basic reason that applies.
