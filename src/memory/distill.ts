/**
 * Knowledge distilled from what is already in memory (D-093): a local model reads memory files and offers
 * short, standalone facts — each with the words it came from — and a person says yes or no to each one.
 * Only the yeses are written, as notes in `memory/knowledge/facts/<topic>.md`.
 *
 * The same discipline as persona drafts (S6.1, D-072): every fact carries a quote copied from its source,
 * and a fact whose quote is not in the text it was read from is cut, never offered — a model that
 * invents is caught by arithmetic, not by trust. Nothing is written without a person's yes.
