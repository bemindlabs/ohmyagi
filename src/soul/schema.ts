/**
 * What a soul is, and what makes one malformed.
 *
 * Two files, never one. D-006.4 asks for role knowledge and personal traits to
 * be separated *physically* — a different file, not a different field — so that
 * deleting one cannot take the other with it (`erase --personal`, S7.2 AC5).
 * A single file with a `[person]` table would satisfy the letter of I-5 and
 * none of its purpose, because the delete you actually want to perform is
 * `rm person.md`.
 *
 * Every function here takes the subject as an argument and checks it against
 * what the file declares. A soul that belongs to nobody in particular is how
 * identities start to bleed (I-3), so "which subject is this?" is answered by
 * the caller and confirmed by the file, never inferred from a directory name.
 *
 * Validation collects *all* issues rather than throwing on the first. Someone
 * hand-writing a soul wants the whole list, and a validator that stops early
 * teaches them to fix one line per run.
