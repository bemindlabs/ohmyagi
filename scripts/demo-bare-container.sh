# B3 — the demo the whole of MVP-lite is defined by.
#
#   make an agent -> give it an identity -> `git clone` it into a bare
#   container that has only ollama -> `soul verify` passes -> a turn finishes
#
# It is a shell script rather than a subcommand because every step it
# orchestrates is somebody else's program: `bun build`, `git`, `docker`. None
# of that belongs inside an engine whose whole claim is that it needs no
# runtime of its own.
#
# ## What "a bare container" means here, stated rather than implied
#
# A stock `debian:bullseye-slim`, unmodified, with exactly two things copied
# in: the single `om-agi` binary from `bun build --compile`, and the working
# tree that came out of `git clone`. No bun, no node, no git, no curl, no
# vendor CLI, no credentials, no volume, and no image built by this script.
#
#   - **A binary, not bun.** Installing bun inside would need network and an
#     installer, which is no longer bare — and the binary proves the stronger
#     claim anyway: no runtime is required at all (ADR 0001 §1).
#   - **ollama lives outside the container**, on the host, reached over the
#     docker bridge gateway. "Only ollama" means the one endpoint reachable
#     from in there is a local model daemon.
#   - **`git clone` runs on the host.** What I-2 has to prove is that what git
#     holds is enough for the agent to stand up, and the bytes that arrive are
#     the same checkout either way. Installing git inside would mean `apt-get`
#     against a bullseye whose LTS has ended, so the demo would fail because
#     of a mirror rather than because of om-agi — a failure that teaches
#     nothing. `docs/demo.md` says this out loud rather than burying it.
#
# ## The two things that cannot both be proved in one box
#
# A reader meeting the guard criterion below will notice it does not run in the
# container, and should be told why rather than only that.
#
# This demo proves the container is bare, and the strongest evidence for that
# is that `git` is not in it — it is on the forbidden list a few lines up, and
# the script fails if it resolves. But `om-agi guard` is a **git hook**: it is
# a file in `.git/hooks` that git executes, reading the index through git. A
# box with no git has nothing for it to hang on and no index for it to read.
#
# So the two proofs want opposite boxes. Installing git to prove the guard
# would delete the thing the other eleven criteria rest on; skipping the guard
# because the box has none would leave the acceptance criterion that caught a
# real escape (`100b791`, a typechange the scan never read) outside every
# claim this demo makes. Neither is acceptable, so the guard is proved on the
# **host**, against the same binary, on a clone of its own — and every line
# that reports it says so, here and in the output, because a reader who sees
# fifteen rows should not have to guess which of them were proved where.
#
# That is not a defect in the demo. It is the shape of the claim: *bare* and
# *guarded by git* are two different machines, and om-agi has to work on both.
#
# ## How this script is kept from lying
#
# A demo that prints PASS without having proven anything is worse than no
# demo at all, so four things are deliberate:
#
#   1. Every value `soul verify` asks for is randomised per run. The template
#      says the user is addressed as `"you"`, which a model carrying no soul
#      guesses correctly — a pass built on that means nothing.
#   2. The values in the verify report are checked back against the values
#      written before the clone, so the identity being measured is provably
#      the one that travelled through git.
#   3. A negative control runs first: pointed at a port nobody listens on,
#      `soul verify` and `turn` must both fail. If either succeeds, this
#      script cannot tell success from failure and the demo is reported FAIL.
#   4. No retries, no reduced `--runs`, no relaxed threshold. `partial` is a
#      failure and is reported as one.
#   5. Controls are run and reported, and are **not** counted as criteria. A
#      control is what shows the instrument still works — a clean commit the
#      hook lets through, a search that finds the id *before* anything is
#      erased — not a thing om-agi is being credited with. Counting them would
#      grow the number without growing the evidence. Every one of them aborts
#      the whole run when it fails, exactly as a criterion does.
#   6. `erase` is asked in both directions in the same box: a subject that was
#      never here must come back `nothing-found` and touch nothing, and the
#      subject that is here must come back `erased-and-verified` and leave the
#      id findable nowhere. One direction alone passes for a command whose
#      verdict is a constant.
#
# Exit codes, which are deliberately not collapsed into a boolean:
#
#   0  proven
#   1  ran, and did not pass
#   2  did not run (preflight) — not a result about om-agi at all

# docs/demo.md says so rather than letting a reader assume otherwise.
#
# Capabilities are deliberately *not* dropped, and this comment is here so
# that nobody adds `--cap-drop ALL` back. `docker cp` keeps the uid and mode of
# the files it carries, so the checkout arrives owned by whoever ran this and
# — under a umask of 077 — unreadable to anyone else. Root inside the
# container then needs CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE to read the soul and to write `.dagi/`
# beside it. With the capability gone, `rebuild` reports the soul as missing
# and the demo fails for a reason that has nothing to do with om-agi. What is
# being proven here is "a bare machine with a local model", not "a hardened
# sandbox", and the second must not be allowed to counterfeit a failure of the
# first.
