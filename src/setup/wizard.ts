/**
 * `ohmyagi setup` — the first run, one question at a time (D-056).
 *
 * A wizard over commands that already exist, never a second way to do what
 * they do: it runs `new`, writes the soul through the same serializer `new`
 * and `soul import` use, runs `soul check`, and runs one `turn`. Everything
 * here is pure — the questions, their defaults, and what the answers become —
 * so the command that asks them stays small and a test can pose any answer.
 *
 * What setup deliberately does not do, and says so at the end:
 *
 * - **Raise the autonomy dial.** Level 1 (propose) is the default, and level 3
 *   needs a phrase typed at a terminal (D-042). A wizard that offered "let it
 *   act" as one keypress among many would be the easy path around that.
 * - **Turn on capture.** Consent is typed by the person it is about
 *   (`observe enable`), not accepted on their behalf by an installer.
 * - **Write into the CLIs' own instruction files.** `soul apply` shows a diff
 *   first; setup prints that command instead of running it with `--apply`.
