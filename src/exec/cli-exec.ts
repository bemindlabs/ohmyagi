/**
 * Running a turn on a vendor CLI — a subprocess that can lie about finishing.
 *
 * Everything defensive in this file exists because of one measured behaviour:
 * these CLIs fail by exiting 0 with nothing to show for it. A tool call nobody
 * approves, a plan mode nobody can approve, a prompt truncated in the middle —
 * each produces a clean exit and an empty or half answer. So a zero exit code
 * is treated as a claim to be checked, never as a result — and where a vendor
 * says how its turn ended, that is checked too (`VendorSpec.completion`).
