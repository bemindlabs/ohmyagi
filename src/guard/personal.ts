/**
 * Where data flagged `personal` lives: outside the repository, and checked.
 *
 * S0.4 AC4 is a claim about a *location*, and D-014 explains why it could not
 * have been a `.gitignore` line instead. Three ordinary things defeat an ignore
 * rule: `git clean -fdx` deletes ignored files, so "ignored" is not "kept";
 * `cp -r agent/ elsewhere/` carries them along with no git involved at all; and
 * one edit to `.gitignore` commits them, after which git remembers what it was
 * asked to forget. A different filesystem tree survives all three.
 *
 * Two things are enforced here and neither is a convention:
 *
 * - **The directory is per subject, and the subject is an argument.** Never
 *   inferred from the agent's directory name (I-3). A directory name is a hint;
 *   an identity is a claim, and letting the first become the second is how one
 *   identity's data ends up under another's name.
 * - **The resolved path must not be inside any git repository.** `XDG_DATA_HOME`
 *   is a variable, a variable can point anywhere, and `~/work/notes` being a git
 *   checkout is not unusual. {@link personalDir} refuses rather than writing
 *   there, using the same walk `ohmyagi new` and `soul import` already refuse by.
 *
 * What is *not* here is the flag itself. `personal` has no shape in any type
 * yet — that is S3.5 (w2). w1 enforces the place, and the pre-commit scan
 * refuses anything staged under a `personal/` directory so that the place
 * cannot be quietly moved back inside the repository.
