/**
 * Level 3 counts only where a person confirmed it, on this machine (D-042).
 *
 * `autonomy.md` lives in git beside the soul, and an agent acting at level 2
 * may write files — including that one. Before this file, typing `write = 3`
 * into it skipped the phrase `autonomy set` asks for at a terminal (S5.1 AC4).
 * Now `autonomy set <category> 3` leaves a record here, outside the
 * repository, and a 3 the file claims without a record is held at 2.
 *
 * The record is keyed by the soul directory's absolute path, so a clone
 * elsewhere starts unconfirmed: letting an agent act without asking is a
 * decision of the person on that machine, and does not travel with the repo.
 *
 * What this does not do: a vendor CLI runs as the owner's uid and can write
 * here too. It turns "edit one line of the repo you are working in" into
 * "forge a second file, outside it, on purpose". The real boundary is a
 * separate uid or a sandbox, which is outside om-agi.
