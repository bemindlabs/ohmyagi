/**
 * A signed usage report, version 2, pinned for the platform's verifier (S16.4, platform PR #6) — S15.9, the
 * PR #3 review, and the binding of S15.4 step one (D-141).
 *
 * `test/fixtures/usage-report-v2.json` is exactly what `ohmyagi usage report --json --market
 * https://market.example --listing ts-reviewer` prints for the ledger lines below, signed with RFC 8032's
 * test-1 key (its public key is `test/fixtures/usage-report-v2.key`); `usage-report-v2-job.json` is the same
 * with `--job job_01`. Ed25519 is deterministic, so this test rebuilds each report from those lines and
 * requires the same bytes: a change to the row shape, the binding, the canonical JSON, the cost formula or the
 * table digest cannot pass quietly — it has to change the fixture, which the platform then sees.
 *
 * The rows are chosen to cover what a verifier has to get right:
 *
 * | row | what it pins |
 * |---|---|
 * | v2-claude | a charged claude row from the shipped table, every part used: 41850 µ$ exactly |
 * | v2-grok | grok's null cache-write rate with a cache-write count of 0 — still charged: 24000 µ$ |
 * | v2-ollama | a null-cache row (ollama prints none), priced from the owner's table with its digest, and a half rounded up: 1.5 → 2 µ$ |
 * | v2-haiku | a half rounded up on its own: 5 cache-read tokens at $0.10/MTok is 0.5 → 1 µ$ |
 * | v2-codex | not charged: one total, no parts (`usage-unsplit`) |
 *
 * Those two are priced from the shipped table `2026-09-28` — the default when they were made — and are
 * **byte-for-byte what they were before D-143**: their lines are rebuilt with that table named, and no row of
 * theirs wrote to the 1-hour cache, so none carries a field D-143 added. They still verify here, because this
 * build still carries `2026-09-28`, and the platform's copies of them still pass its own tests unchanged.
 *
 * `test/fixtures/usage-report-v2-split.json` (D-143) is priced from the table in force now, `2026-09-29`, with
 * the same key and binding, and pins what a verifier has to get right about a cache write split by cache:
 *
 * | row | what it pins |
 * |---|---|
 * | v2s-sonnet-split | 1,000 written to the 5-minute cache and 2,000 to the 1-hour one, each at its own rate: 46350 µ$; the row has `cache_write_1h_tokens` and its cost the rate `cache_write_1h` |
 * | v2s-haiku-1h | D-142's measured turn — every write to the 1-hour cache: 24047 µ$ (15155 at the 5-minute rate) |
 * | v2s-sonnet5-5m | a charged row from `2026-09-29` with only 5-minute writes: no new field, the shape a verifier from before D-143 reads |
 * | v2s-opus-unsplit | a write whose split claude did not print: not charged (`usage-unsplit`), and no split field |
 * | v2s-local-1h | the owner's own price with a 1-hour rate: charged, `owner`, NOT checked — 740 µ$ |
 * | v2s-owner-no1h | the owner's price with no 1-hour rate, and a 1-hour write: not charged (`price-unknown`), the split still on the row |
 *
 * To regenerate after a deliberate change: `OM_AGI_WRITE_VECTOR=1 bun test test/identity/report-vector.test.ts`,
 * then say in the PR what changed, because the platform's copy has to change with it.
