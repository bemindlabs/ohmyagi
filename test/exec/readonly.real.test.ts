/**
 * The read-only flags, tried on the vendors themselves — opt-in, and the only
 * layer here that can tell you a fence is still a fence.
 *
 * Run with:
 *
 *     OM_AGI_REAL_READONLY=1 bun test test/exec/readonly.real.test.ts
 *
 * Skipped otherwise, and skipped on purpose: each case spends a real turn on a
 * logged-in CLI, which costs quota and writes a transcript into the operator's
 * own home. That is the same bargain `usage.real.test.ts` documents.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists at all
 *
 * Everything in the default suite checks that om-agi builds the argv it says it
 * builds. None of it can check the claim that argv actually makes, because that
 * claim is about somebody else's program: *this flag stops this CLI from
 * writing a file*. A registry can be green, consistent and completely wrong
 * about it — which is not hypothetical. Until 2026-09-21 grok was held with a
 * deny list naming `run_terminal_cmd` and `task`; the vendor had renamed both,
 * the flag was still in the argv, the test that looked for it still passed, and
 * this probe asked for a file and got one.
 *
 * ## What each outcome means
 *
 * - A vendor that declares a mechanism and writes nothing: the registry is
 *   still true, and its `evidence` is earned rather than assumed.
 * - A vendor that declares a mechanism **and writes**: the vendor moved. Every
 *   turn om-agi has run since it moved was unguarded, and nothing said so.
 * - A vendor that declares `none` and writes: the hole is exactly where the
 *   registry says it is.
 * - A vendor that declares `none` and does *not* write: also a failure here,
 *   deliberately. Either the vendor grew a limit the registry should adopt, or
 *   this turn simply declined — and the difference is worth a person's minute,
 *   because one of the two readings means a line in `readonlyLimits()` is
 *   frightening people about a hole that has been closed.
 * - A vendor whose turn neither wrote nor answered — an expired login, a
 *   withdrawn tier, a timeout — is reported as measuring nothing. It is not
 *   counted as agreement, because a CLI that cannot start writes no files
 *   either, and that would make an unreachable vendor the most reassuring row
 *   in the table.
 *
 * Nothing is named here (D-021): the working directory is a fresh temporary
 * one, the subject is synthetic, and no path is spelled out.
