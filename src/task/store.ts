/**
 * D-154 — a task: a goal handed to the agent, worked on one ordinary `turn` at a time until it is done, it runs
 * out of budget, or somebody stops it.
 *
 * ## Where it lives, and why there
 *
 * `$XDG_DATA_HOME/om-agi/<subject>/personal/tasks/<task>/` — beside the proposal store, for the reason that store
 * is where it is (D-029): a goal, a plan and a step's summary are free text, and free text never goes into git
 * (S3.2 AC5). Under `personal/`, so `ohmyagi erase` removes every task with everything else personal (I-4), and
 * a runner that finds its directory gone stops rather than make it again ({@link writeTask} never creates one).
 *
 * | file | what | who writes it |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `task.json` | the record: goal, budget, plan, every step, status | `task new`, then the task's runner alone — and `task stop` once that runner is gone |
 * | `stop` | a request to stop | `task stop`, `ohmyagi stop` |
 * | `prompt-<n>.txt` | the prompt of the step running now (600, removed after the step) | the runner |
 * | `runner.log` | what a detached runner would have printed | the runner |
 * | `runner-env-<random>` | the environment a runner started in a unit of its own is to run with, as an `EnvironmentFile=` (600; S18.1, `unit.ts`) | `task new\|resume --detach`; systemd reads it as it starts the runner and the starter removes it at once (leftovers over a minute old are swept on the next start) |
 * | `approvals/` | the sensitive browser actions this task asked about (D-156, `approvals.ts`) | the runner, `task approve`/`deny` |
 *
 * One writer per file at a time is the whole concurrency rule. `task.json` is replaced whole (a temporary name,
 * then `rename`), so a reader never sees half of it; the runner is the only process that rewrites it while it
 * lives, and anything else that wants something of a running task writes its own file (`stop`, an approval's
 * claim) and lets the runner read it.
 *
 * ## What is not here
 *
 * The ledger. Each step is an ordinary turn and the turn writes its own ledger line (S2.2); the step records the
 * turn's id, which is the link between the two. Nothing here reads the ledger back (D-022).
