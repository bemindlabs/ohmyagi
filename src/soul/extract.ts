/**
 * S6.1 — a soul drafted from real artifacts, every line tied to its source (D-072).
 *
 * The owner hands over artifacts — documents, work chats, code, tickets — and
 * a model **on this machine** proposes claims about the job: what it does,
 * what it never does, what it knows, and (kept to the minimum, in its own
 * file) how the person works. Each claim must come with a verbatim quote, and
 * a claim whose quote is not in the artifact is cut as made up (AC2). What
 * survives is a draft the owner answers yes or no to, line by line (AC4);
 * only the yeses reach the soul, and each carries where it came from.
 *
 * Artifacts are the owner's and leave nothing behind outside the personal
 * directory: the model is checked to be a loopback one before anything is
 * read to it, and the draft — which quotes the artifacts — is written under
 * `personal/`, which `erase` removes whole.
 *
 * This file is pure except for {@link collectArtifacts}; the model call and
 * the files are the command's.
