/**
 * `soul revoke` — every file `soul apply` touched, back as it was (S1.5).
 *
 * Two facts make "as it was" checkable rather than hoped. `strip` returns the
 * text outside om-agi's markers byte for byte (Phase A criterion 3), and every
 * apply wrote a manifest recording, per file, whether it existed and the
 * sha256 of what it held before. So each file is stripped and its new bytes
 * are compared with the **earliest** recorded sha — the state before om-agi
 * ever wrote there. A file om-agi created, and that holds nothing once the
 * block is gone, is removed: absent is what it was.
 *
 * A file that no longer matches — somebody edited around the block since — is
 * still stripped, keeps the edits, and says so. Revoke takes back what om-agi
 * wrote and nothing else.
 *
 * Plan, then commit, like `apply` and `erase`: {@link planRevoke} reads and
 * writes nothing; {@link commitRevoke} takes the plan.
