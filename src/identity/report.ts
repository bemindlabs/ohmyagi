/**
 * A usage report: what the agent's turns used, one row per model delivery, ready to sign (S15.4 minimum,
 * S15.8, D-106, D-110) — and the checks a report must pass when it is read back.
 *
 * Built from the ledger and from nothing else, and built by **copying named fields into a new object** —
 * never by deleting fields from a ledger line. A line holds the prompt and the answer verbatim (`prompt`,
 * `text`) and their sizes; a report that started from the line and removed what should not go would send
 * whatever field the ledger grows next. So the row below lists what goes, and a field the ledger adds later
 * goes nowhere until somebody adds it here — `test/identity/report.test.ts` holds the row to exactly these
 * names and plants a canary in every text field of the line.
 *
 * What a row carries: the line's and the turn's ids (random UUIDs, so a reader can see a row counted twice),
 * when it started and how long it took, which backend and model received it, the tokens the backend printed —
 * input, output, and the cache reads and writes inside that input — and what the turn cost (S15.9). What it
 * never carries: the prompt, the answer, their byte sizes, the soul, anything recalled from memory, the
 * subject id, any path.
 *
 * ## The schema, version 2 (S15.9, D-139)
 *
 * `{kind: "ohmyagi.usage-report", v: 2, generated_at, since, until, binding, rows}`, and each row exactly:
 *
 * | field | value |
 * |---|---|
 * | `id`, `turn` | the ledger line's id and its turn's id |
 * | `at` | ISO-8601 UTC instant the prompt left |
 * | `duration_ms` | whole milliseconds, or null |
 * | `backend`, `model` | a plain backend id; a model's name, or null — the backend's own default, unnamed |
 * | `input_tokens` | the whole prompt side, cache included, or null |
 * | `output_tokens` | or null |
 * | `cache_read_tokens`, `cache_write_tokens` | the parts of `input_tokens` read from and written to the vendor's cache, or null |
 * | `cache_write_1h_tokens` | **only on a row whose turn wrote to the 1-hour cache** (D-143): the part of `cache_write_tokens` that went there, 1 or more |
 * | `usage` | `reported`, `missing`, `unreported` or `not-recorded` — see below |
 * | `cost` | null, or `{usd_micros, table, table_digest, source, usd_micros_per_mtok}` |
 * | `not_charged` | null when `cost` is not; otherwise why it is (`src/pricing/cost.ts`) |
 *
 * **Money is integers of a named unit.** `usd_micros` is US micro-dollars — 1 is $0.000001 — and every rate
 * in `usd_micros_per_mtok` (`input`, `output`, `cache_read`, `cache_write`, each a whole number or null) is
 * micro-dollars per million tokens. Integers because the canonical JSON the report is signed over allows no
 * fractions (D-138). `table` is the version of the price table the rates came from and `source` is
 * `default` (shipped in om-agi) or `owner` (the agent's owner's own file). A charged row that has
 * `cache_write_1h_tokens` has a fifth rate, `cache_write_1h`, and no other row has it (D-143).
 *
 * **Every cost can be re-checked from its own row**, and `usage verify` does: with `uncached = input_tokens −
 * cache_read_tokens − cache_write_tokens` (a null cache count is a part the backend never prints, and counts
 * as nothing) and `write1h = cache_write_1h_tokens` (0 when the row has none), `usd_micros = (uncached × input
 * + cache_read_tokens × cache_read + (cache_write_tokens − write1h) × cache_write + write1h × cache_write_1h
 * + output_tokens × output + 500000) // 1000000`. A row whose cost is not that number is refused, however it
 * is signed. A charged row's `usage` is `reported` and its input and output are counts; a part above zero
 * has a rate.
 *
 * **Why the 1-hour fields are there only when used (D-143).** v2 had not been released when they were added,
 * but a market (platform migration 0006) already reads v2 rows with exactly the fields above, and refuses a
 * row with one more. With `write1h` 0 the formula is the one before D-143 term for term, so a row with no
 * 1-hour write carries nothing new and every such report stays one that market takes; a row with one is new
 * money arithmetic, and a market that cannot do it must refuse it rather than recompute it wrong. One
 * spelling each way: a row never carries `cache_write_1h_tokens: 0`, and a cost never carries the 1-hour rate
 * it did not apply.
 *
 * **No totals are signed.** A total is the sum of the rows' `usd_micros` and counts, and `usage report` and
 * `usage verify` print it from the rows; a signed total beside them could only ever disagree with them.
 *
 * ## Where the report is going: `binding` (S15.4 step one, D-141 §2)
 *
 * `binding` is null, or exactly `{market, listing, job}`: the market's origin (`scheme://host[:port]`, the
 * rule in `shapes.ts`), the listing's slug on it, and the job's id there or null. It is signed with the rows,
 * so a report made for one listing cannot be counted at another, nor at another market (platform PR #6
 * review, M3) — the platform takes a report only when `binding` names its own origin and that listing. A
 * report with `binding: null` is for its own machine: `usage report` without `--market` and `--listing`
 * makes one, and a market refuses it. The field is always there, null or not, so no reader can mistake an
 * unbound report for an older shape. `usage verify --market --listing` holds a report to both; without
 * them it prints the binding and says it was not checked.
 *
 * v2 had not been released when `binding` was added, so it is still v2 and a v2 report without it is refused.
 *
 * ## Only model turns
 *
 * The ledger also records messages — A2A (`a2a:in:<peer>`) and chat (`chat:<platform>:<direction>:<user>`) —
 * and those backends name a peer or a person. A row is a model turn only if its backend is a plain id (`claude`,
 * `ollama`, `claude-local`); anything with a `:` or any other shape is left out and counted, so a new kind of
 * line is kept out until someone decides it belongs rather than let in until someone notices.
 *
 * ## Unknown is null, never zero
 *
 * Every count is exactly what the ledger holds: a number the backend printed, or null. A line written before
 * usage was recorded has no `usage` at all and its row says `usage: "not-recorded"`; a backend nobody has
 * surveyed says `unreported`; one whose count went missing says `missing`. Under `reported`, a null count is
 * one the backend never prints (ollama prints no cache counts; codex prints one total and no parts). None of
 * them is 0, because 0 is a count — and D-110 bills a turn without a count at nothing, which only works if a
 * missing count is visibly missing. The same goes for money: a turn that cannot be priced has `cost: null`
 * and a reason, never a cost of 0 and never an estimate; a line from before S15.9 says `not-recorded`.
 *
 * ## Every string has a shape (S15.8 security review, M2 and the info items)
 *
 * A report is printed on somebody's terminal — the owner's, and a verifier's — so no string in it may carry a
 * control character, an escape sequence or a bidi override. Each field has a shape, the producer writes only
 * rows that have it, and a reader refuses a report with any string outside it:
 *
 * - `id`, `turn`, `cost.table` — letters, digits and `._:-`, up to 128. A ledger line whose ids are not
 *   (hand-edited, or written by something else) is left out and counted, never cleaned up into a row — and so
 *   is one whose cost does not follow from its own counts and rates.
 * - `at`, `generated_at`, `since`, `until` — an ISO-8601 UTC instant (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS[.fff]Z`), or null
 *   for an open end. The producer writes `at` through `toISOString`.
 * - `backend` — a plain id, the rule above.
 * - `model` — the name the row's price was looked up by: the model the backend ran, or, on a row charged while a
 *   vendor CLI named no model, the name om-agi asked for, which a price table listed exactly (D-142). A row that
 *   is not charged never names a model the backend was only asked for.
 *   A model's *name*: `name` or `org/name`, each part letters, digits and `._:@+-` starting with a
 *   letter or digit, up to 128. `--model` can be a path to a local weights file; a value with more than one
 *   `/`, a leading `/`, `.` or `~`, a space or anything else a name does not have is sent as **null**, and the
 *   report says how many rows that happened to. The choice is to refuse rather than to take a basename,
 *   because the last part of a path is still a name somebody chose, and a report is not the place to guess
 *   which names are private.
 * - `duration_ms` — a whole number of milliseconds or null. The ledger allows any finite number there; a
 *   fraction is rounded, and a negative or unsafe one is null, rather than crashing the signer.
 *
 * {@link printable} escapes anything outside printable text before it is shown, whether or not it passed.
