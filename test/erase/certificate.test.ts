/**
 * AC2 — the certificate: what, how many records, when, who asked.
 *
 * The interesting assertions here are all about what the document must *not*
 * say. A certificate is the artefact somebody keeps and quotes later, so every
 * way it could overstate is a way a person acts on a deletion that did not
 * happen:
 *
 * - it must never put a `5` next to a deletion, because two of AC1's five
 *   places have no code behind them;
 * - it must not carry the text of a `--needle`, because echoing the thing
 *   somebody asked to delete into a file they will keep is the opposite of the
 *   request;
 * - it must not carry a hash of what was removed either — a digest of a name,
 *   an address or a short prompt is guessable, which is the same reasoning that
 *   keeps `--private` from storing one;
 * - `who` must read as a claim rather than as an attestation, because om-agi
 *   authenticates nobody.
 *
 * And one about what it must say: on a dry run, that the verification did not
 * run. A document whose verification section is full of zeros because nothing
 * was checked looks exactly like one where everything was clean.
