/**
 * Triage a proposal with TypeSafe's Jev — opt-in, and advisory only (D-059).
 *
 * Jev is a "System One" model: instead of text it answers typed questions
 * with a probability distribution and a confidence. Asked about a proposal's
 * what / why / impact, it says what kind of action it is, whether it can be
 * undone, and whether it touches somebody's private information — which is
 * the first thing an owner reads a proposal for.
 *
 * What it never does: approve, refuse, or act. The labels sit beside the
 * proposal in `proposal list` and `proposal show`; the decision stays a
 * person's (S5.2, D-045). A triage that failed or was kept in changes nothing
 * about what the proposal is.
 *
 * It is a cloud call, so the proposal's text leaves this machine. Three things
 * follow from that and are enforced here, not in the caller:
 * - Off unless asked: `ohmyagi proposal triage` on demand, or every filing
 *   when `OM_AGI_TRIAGE=jev` is set. There is no default key and no default on.
 * - The text goes through the same egress filter a turn does (S8.3, D-048)
 *   first; a finding means nothing is sent.
 * - The key comes from `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` (or a file named by
 *   `TYPESAFE_API_KEY_FILE`) and is never written anywhere by om-agi.
