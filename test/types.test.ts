/**
 * `subjectId` — the one piece of runtime behaviour in `src/types.ts`, and the
 * reason this file exists.
 *
 * `SubjectId` is the brand that makes I-3 (identities never bleed) checkable
 * instead of aspirational: a leak needs a `SubjectId` to have been passed, and
 * every call site that passes one is greppable. All of that rests on the brand
 * being unforgeable at the edge — which is `subjectId()` refusing a value that
 * is not a safe directory name.
 *
 * Until the coverage gate grew a per-file line floor, that refusal had no test
 * on it. The file scored 70% and passed anyway, because some other test had
 * imported a *type* from it and "loaded" was the whole question the gate asked.
 * The three uncovered lines were the `throw`. This is what the floor is for.
 *
 * Every id below is synthetic (D-021): no real subject, no real path.
