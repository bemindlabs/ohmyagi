/**
 * `ohmyagi stop` — S5.4, in a fixed order, where the step most likely to work
 * comes first.
 *
 * 1. **Set the brake.** A file under the state root. No parsing, no network, no
 *    repository, no process to find. Somebody typing this command wants the
 *    next turn not to start, and this is the step that cannot really fail.
 * 2. **Take every category to 0 in `autonomy.md`,** when a directory was named.
 *    A convenience: a repository that cannot be written does not stop steps 1
 *    or 3. Step 1 is the answer; this one makes the intent visible in `git
 *    diff`.
 * 3. **End the turns that are running.** Read the run records, check that each
 *    pid is still the process the record was written about, signal what can be
 *    identified, and **print the command for what cannot**.
 * 4. **`docker kill` every browser task** of this state root (D-151), recorded
 *    or not — a container is identified by its labels, never by a guess.
 * 5. **Ask every task to stop** (D-154): its runner starts no next step, also
 *    after the brake is released.
 *
 * Each step reports separately and a failure in one does not skip the next,
 * because the person running this does not get to choose which failure they are
 * having.
 *
 * ## What it refuses to do
 *
 * It never signals a process it cannot identify. A pid is reused, so a record
 * whose pid now has a different start time is `stale` and is reported rather
 * than acted on; a machine with no `/proc` gets the manual command instead of a
 * guess. And it addresses a *group* only where the target is its own group
 * leader — which is the shape `detached: true` gives the vendor children, and
 * the shape an inherited group never has. See `src/decide/runs.ts` for the
 * measurements behind both rules.
