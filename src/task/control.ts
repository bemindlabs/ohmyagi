/**
 * Stopping a task (D-154): `task stop`, and `ohmyagi stop`'s reach into every task.
 *
 * A stop is asked, then made sure of:
 *
 * 1. the task's `stop` file — the runner looks for it before every step and after each one, so no next step
 *    starts;
 * 2. the step's turn, if one is running, is ended the way `ohmyagi stop` ends any turn: its run record, its pid
 *    and start time checked, SIGTERM then SIGKILL to what it started (D-044, `terminateRun`) — the step's vendor
 *    CLI runs in a process group of its own, so ending only the `turn` process would leave it running;
 * 3. the runner then closes the task as `stopped`, ends its browser and exits. A task whose runner is gone
 *    already is closed here instead — nothing else is writing its record.
 * 4. S18.1: a runner in a unit of its own (`unit.ts`) — its unit is stopped too: once the task is closed (the unit
 *    then ends with the runner), and before giving up on a runner that has not closed it in time — SIGTERM to it
 *    with the stop asked, which it answers by closing the task, and SIGKILL to what is left after
 *    `UNIT_STOP_SECONDS`.
