/**
 * "Did the owner ask for this, or did the machine decide?" — the one field
 * D-024 moved E3 for, and the exact size of the answer.
 *
 * ## Why this is not in the transcripts
 *
 * `S3.2 AC3` asks for the owner's actions separated from the AI's own
 * initiative. SP-1 measured whether that separation exists on disk and it does
 * not: every tool call in every transcript was issued by a model, and whether a
 * person asked for it lives in prose. The only structural handle available
 * afterwards is "did a human type in this session at all", which removes 44% of
 * claude's sessions and 80% of grok's — the fleet's work, not the owner's.
 *
 * At the moment of the action there is more. Measured on claude 2.1.278 (see
 * `docs/cli-matrix.md`), a `UserPromptSubmit` hook payload carries a `source`
 * field whose values are the vendor's own account of who authored the turn:
 *
 * - `user` — submitted from the interactive composer;
 * - `sdk` — the non-interactive entry point, which is `claude -p` and the Agent
 *   SDK, and therefore every fleet launcher on this machine;
 * - `loop_wakeup`, `schedule_wakeup`, `system`, `poll_event` — machine-injected
 *   turns of one kind or another.
 *
 * That is a far better signal than the plan for w4 expected to have, and it is
 * still a claim by the vendor about its own entry point rather than evidence
 * that a person was at the keyboard. The vendor's own schema adds that payloads
 * may omit the field entirely while it rolls out.
 *
 * ## The rule, and the one thing it refuses to do
 *
 * `unknown` is never folded into `owner-prompted`. It is the same shape as
 * `silent` in ADR 0001 and `UsageStatus.unreported` in `src/types.ts`: the
 * honest report of "nobody said" is its own value, because an agent that
 * learned the fleet's habits as its owner's would be precisely the failure
 * `S3.2 AC3` exists to prevent, and it would look like success.
 *
 * ## Why session state exists, and why it is a file
 *
 * Each hook firing is its own process. A `PostToolUse` payload says nothing
 * about who asked — the `source` was on the `UserPromptSubmit` that came before
 * it, in a process that has already exited. So the prompt's evidence is written
 * to a small file keyed by session, and the tool events read it back.
 *
 * The file lives *inside* the observer directory, which is what makes
 * `observe purge` and `ohmyagi erase` reach it without either of them being
 * taught about it (I-4).
