/**
 * What a turn that was allowed to act changed — S5.2 AC4 (D-043).
 *
 * At level 2 a vendor CLI runs without its read-only flag. "Act, then report"
 * needs a report, and before this file there was only a warning printed
 * *before* the turn. So om-agi takes a snapshot of the directory the vendor
 * runs in before and after, and says what differs before the turn ends.
 *
 * A snapshot is size and mtime per file, not a hash: it is taken twice per
 * turn over a tree that may be large, and the question is *did this change*,
 * which size-or-mtime answers for every write that is not deliberately
 * disguised. What it cannot see is printed with it ({@link REPORT_LIMITS}).
