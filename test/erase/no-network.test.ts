/**
 * I-1 for `src/erase/` — and the exact size of what it proves.
 *
 * **Proven:** no module reachable from `src/erase/` names a network global,
 * imports a network module, or is anything under `src/exec/`. Deleting
 * somebody's data is not an operation that needs a model, and a layer that
 * could reach one is a layer that could send what it read somewhere on the way
 * to deleting it (I-6). The interesting form of that failure is not `fetch`: it
 * is an innocent-looking import of `resolveTargets`, which lives in
 * `src/soul/targets.ts` and pulls in the vendor registry. That is why
 * `bin/om-agi.ts` resolves the instruction files and hands this layer a list of
 * strings, and why the assertion below is about a whole directory rather than
 * about one call.
 *
 * **Not proven, and deliberately allowed:** the closure *does* contain
 * `src/spawn.ts`, through `src/guard/history.ts`. Erase counts commits with
 * `git rev-list`, which is on `spawnGuarded`'s closed verb allowlist and
 * reaches no remote; `test/guard/no-push.test.ts` runs the real command under a
 * `git` that records its argv and asserts no network verb appears. So the check
 * here is not "nothing can start a process" — that would be false and the test
 * would be written to pass anyway — but "the only way it can is through the one
 * chokepoint, which has its own three layers".
 *
 * **Allowed since D-038, and only in one file:** `src/memory/store-admin.ts`
 * uses `fetch`. The `rag` place's data lives in Qdrant, so a deleter for it has
 * to reach Qdrant — and it does it the way the rule about processes is kept:
 * one chokepoint, which can `GET` or `DELETE` a collection by name on a
 * loopback literal and cannot send a body (`test/memory/store-admin.test.ts`).
 * Nothing the erase layer reads off disk has a way into a request.
 *
 * Both assertions have a control: the same scanners pointed at `src/exec/`,
 * where a socket really does live, and at synthetic source they must catch.
