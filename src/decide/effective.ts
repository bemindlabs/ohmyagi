/**
 * One rule, applied to every source: **a source may lower a level, never raise one.**
 *
 * ```
 * effective(category) = min( the file , the environment ceiling , the stop flag )
 * ```
 *
 * There is no source in this program that can raise a level, and the absence is
 * the design rather than a gap. The argument is the one `src/exec/egress.ts`
 * already makes about its own missing off-switch — *"Who may switch it off.
 * Nobody."* — and it applies here with one extra turn of the screw: om-agi runs
 * agents, and an agent runs as the owner. A variable that could raise autonomy
 * is a variable the thing being restrained can export for itself, one
 * subprocess before it starts the next om-agi. Lowering has no such problem: an
 * agent that sets its own ceiling to 0 has only stopped itself.
 *
 * ## The environment variable is a **ceiling**, and is read as an exact string
 *
 * `OM_AGI_AUTONOMY_MAX` accepts `"0"`, `"1"`, `"2"` and `"3"`, compared with
 * `===`. Everything else — an empty string, `"3 "`, `"03"`, `"three"`, `"4"`,
 * `"-1"` — clamps every category to **0** and says so on the way past.
 *
 * `Number()` and `parseInt` are both deliberately absent. `parseInt("3abc")` is
 * 3, `Number("")` is 0, `Number(" 3 ")` is 3, and `Number("0x3")` is 3: four
 * different ways for text nobody meant as a number to become a number that
 * loosens something. Comparing strings has none of those readings.
 *
 * ## Nothing is clamped in silence
 *
 * Every reduction this file performs comes back as a {@link Clamp} carrying the
 * number that was set, the number that takes effect, and why they differ — and
 * `ohmyagi autonomy set` prints them **at the moment of setting**, not on the day
 * a turn behaves unexpectedly. Two kinds of lie were available to a dial and
 * this closes the second: a setting that has no effect because nothing reads it,
 * and a setting that has no effect because arithmetic elsewhere reduced it. The
 * second is the one {@link import("./autonomy.ts").actLevel}'s minimum
 * introduces, so it is this file's job to say so out loud.
