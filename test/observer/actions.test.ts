/**
 * S3.2 — the three kinds, and the line between what may enter git and what may
 * not.
 *
 * Two questions are asked here over and over, because they are the two ways this
 * feature could quietly become something else:
 *
 * 1. **Did anything out of a record get out of the box?** Every leak test below
 *    puts a path, a project directory, an MCP server's name and a session id
 *    into the records and then greps the *bytes of the summary* for them. A
 *    assertion about keys would pass on the day somebody added a value.
 * 2. **Does a zero mean what a reader will take it to mean?** A `0` under
 *    `owner-prompted` is the case the owner named: it means nobody has turned
 *    capture on, and a row of zeros with no sentence beside it reads as "the
 *    owner did nothing". So the sentence is asserted, in the file and in the
 *    printed output.
 *
 * Every record here is invented (D-021). Nothing reads a real transcript, a real
 * home directory, or a real capture store.
