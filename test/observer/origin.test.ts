/**
 * "Who set this going?" — the field D-024 moved a whole epic for, and the one
 * place this code is most likely to flatter its owner.
 *
 * The failure worth testing for is not a crash. It is `unknown` quietly
 * becoming `owner-prompted`, because that version of the bug produces a
 * plausible-looking pile of records in which the fleet's habits are the
 * owner's. `S3.2 AC3` exists to prevent exactly that, so most of this file is
 * assertions that a missing or unfamiliar signal stays `unknown`.
 *
 * The prompt-source words below were read off the installed claude binary; see
 * `docs/cli-matrix.md` and the header of `src/observer/adapters/claude-hook.ts`.
