/**
 * The turn adapter: what `ohmyagi turn` records about itself.
 *
 * ## Why this door exists (D-032)
 *
 * The hook adapter watches claude from the outside and the seed reads what the
 * vendors left on disk. Neither sees a turn om-agi ran on its own — through
 * ollama, in a container with no vendor CLI at all — and that is precisely the
 * turn I-1 says must keep working. A box that proves the local route and then
 * remembers nothing of it would have the observer switched off on the one path
 * the project is built around. So `ohmyagi turn` records itself, through the same
 * store, under the same consent, with the same shape.
 *
 * ## What one record is, and what it is not
 *
 * A local turn has no tool calls to report: `cli-exec` cannot see inside a
 * vendor's turn, and an ollama chat has nothing inside to see. What is left is
 * the one thing the hook adapter also keeps for a prompt — *that a turn
 * happened*, when, where, whether it was answered, and who set it going. Not a
 * word of the prompt, for the reason `record.ts` gives: a short prompt is
 * guessable from its hash, and the ledger already has a `--private` switch for
 * the text.
 *
 * ## `origin`, and the honesty it costs
 *
 * `S3.2 AC3` is the question this field answers, and the one D-024 found no
 * transcript could. A hook has the vendor's word (`source: "user"`). A turn has
 * only the process it is running in, and the process offers one structural fact:
 * whether a terminal is attached. That is the same handle claude's `user` is —
 * a person at a keyboard — so it is used, and it is written down as
 * `promptSource: "terminal"` in om-agi's own word rather than borrowing the
 * vendor's.
 *
 * Two cases are deliberately `unknown`:
 *
 * - **No terminal.** A script, a fleet, a `docker exec` — nobody knows, so
 *   nobody guesses. A fleet that wants to stay out entirely already has
 *   `OM_AGI_CAPTURE=off`.
 * - **A spent proposal.** The agent proposed and the owner approved, which is
 *   neither "the owner asked for it" nor "a schedule did". The origin vocabulary
 *   has no word for that yet, and adding one changes the counts that reach git
 *   (`S3.2 AC5`), which is a story of its own. Until then the safe direction is
 *   the one `deriveOrigin` takes for a word it does not know: say `unknown`,
 *   never `owner-prompted`. An agent that learned its own proposals as the
 *   owner's habits is the failure AC3 exists to prevent (D-024).
 *
 * `deriveOrigin` itself is not touched: it reasons over vendor words, and
 * "terminal" is not one. The rule lives here, next to the evidence it reads.
