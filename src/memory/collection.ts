/**
 * The address an identity's recall lives at — one definition, keyed by subject.
 *
 * This file holds a naming rule and nothing else. The store and its client
 * arrived with S4.1 (`vector.ts`, `store-admin.ts`, D-038) and both build every
 * address they use from {@link collectionFor}; this file is still the only
 * place the prefix is written.
 *
 * ## Why the name exists before the store does
 *
 * D-007 was a measurement, not a preference. The vector store already on this
 * class of machine had **one collection shared by everything** and the app in
 * front of it had **no delete at all**, so a person's records ingested there
 * could be neither separated nor withdrawn. The decision it produced has two
 * halves: om-agi gets collections of its own, and they are **per subject** —
 * `omagi__<subject>`.
 *
 * A name is the whole of that guarantee. Two identities are isolated in a
 * vector store if and only if they address different collections, and "address"
 * means this string. If the string is computed at two call sites, isolation is
 * a convention two authors are keeping; if it is computed here from a
 * `SubjectId`, it is a property of the type — a caller with no subject cannot
 * name a collection at all, and a caller with one cannot name somebody else's
 * by accident.
 *
 * That is also what makes I-4 reachable later: `erase` can only drop what it
 * can name, and {@link subjectOfCollection} is how a list of collections on a
 * store turns back into a list of subjects.
 *
 * ## What this file may never grow into
 *
 * A client. The sockets under `src/memory/` are in two named files, and
 * `test/erase/places.test.ts` fails if a third appears.
