/**
 * S3.5 AC2, layer C — the criterion's own words, checked at the syscall.
 *
 * Layers A and B (`no-network.test.ts`) read om-agi's source and replace
 * om-agi's globals. Both are arguments about the code in this repository. This
 * layer makes no such assumption: it runs the real CLI as a real process and
 * asks the kernel, through `strace`, whether that process ever called
 * `socket`, `connect` or `sendto`. A socket opened by a transitive dependency,
 * by the runtime, or by code that arrived some way the AST never saw is
 * visible here and nowhere else.
 *
 * ## Why it fails rather than skips when strace is missing
 *
 * A skip is a green tick for a check that did not run, and this is the only
 * layer that would notice a socket the other two are blind to. If strace is
 * unavailable the honest outcome is a red test naming what could not be
 * checked. (Measured on the machine this was written on: `/usr/bin/strace`
 * exists and `kernel.yama.ptrace_scope=1`, which permits tracing a child of
 * the tracing process — which is the only thing done here.)
 *
 * ## The baseline, measured rather than assumed
 *
 * `bun run` on a script that does nothing produces **no** `socket`, `connect`
 * or `sendto` line at all — measured 2026-09-21 on bun 1.4.2. So the assertion
 * for the observer commands is "none", not "no more than the runtime's own",
 * and the first test below re-measures that baseline on every run rather than
 * trusting the sentence you are reading. If a future bun opens an `AF_UNIX`
 * socket at start, that test goes red and says so — which is the right way to
 * find out, rather than an allowance quietly written in now.
