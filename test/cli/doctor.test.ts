/**
 * `ohmyagi doctor`, as a person types it.
 *
 * Spawned rather than called, because what is checked here belongs to the
 * command line: that the flags parse, that the exit code is the one AC7 asks
 * for, that `--json` is a document rather than a table, and that **om-agi
 * itself writes nothing** while inspecting a machine.
 *
 * That last one is narrower than it first looked, and this file is where the
 * narrowing was found rather than assumed. The first version asserted that a
 * `doctor` run leaves the home untouched, and it failed: `--version` starts six
 * other programs, and three of them wrote their own caches and config into the
 * temporary home. So the assertion below is the true one — om-agi creates
 * nothing, `--no-version` leaves the home byte-identical, and a run *with* the
 * probes is measured to change it, which is what keeps the sentence in
 * `DOCTOR_LIMITS` from being prose nobody checked.
 *
 * Every run points at a temporary `HOME`, a temporary `XDG_*`, and two dead
 * ports. Nothing here reaches the real home, the real ollama or the real store,
 * so the result does not depend on what happens to be running on the machine
 * the tests are on.
