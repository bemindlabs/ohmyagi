/**
 * The last moment anything can still be said: before the prompt is handed over.
 *
 * S7.2 AC4 — *"แจ้งก่อนข้อมูลจะเกิดที่จุดนั้น ไม่ใช่ตอนขอลบ"* — was true at two
 * addresses and open at a third. `ohmyagi new` announces what a commit puts
 * beyond reach, `ensureObserverDir` announces what a purge cannot reach, and
 * `turn` announced nothing at all about the one address om-agi can never reach
 * afterwards: a vendor's copy of the owner's own words. {@link VENDORS_HOLD} was
 * already written down — `ledger forget` prints it, and prints it *after*, when
 * a reader can do nothing with it.
 *
 * ## The three judgements this file makes
 *
 * **When.** Per dispatch, not per turn. `FallbackExec` decides at run time who
 * is really handed the text: a chain `claude → codex → ollama` where claude is
 * off PATH gives claude nothing, and naming claude at the start of the turn
 * would be a sentence about a send that never happened. So the notice lives in
 * {@link AnnouncedExec}, one wrapper per member — the same position, for the
 * same reason, that `RecordingExec` already occupies.
 *
 * **What counts as leaving.** {@link notLocal}, asked of the **raw** backend.
 * It is the run-time answer (an `OllamaExec` whose host is a loopback literal,
 * by `instanceof`), and it has to be asked of the backend itself rather than of
 * a wrapper around it, because a wrapper copies the id and `RecordingExec`
 * already does. A loopback ollama prints nothing: a turn that never leaves the
 * machine has nothing to disclose, and a warning on a run where nothing happened
 * teaches people to skip the warning on the run where something does.
 *
 * **Who may switch it off. Nobody.** There is no flag, no env var, no config
 * key and no remembered acknowledgement in this file — an earlier draft of w3b
 * had one and it was rejected, on four grounds worth keeping written down:
 * every limits list in this repo prints on every run by design, so the first
 * exception becomes the precedent for the next; the fact being disclosed is the
 * most irreversible one om-agi handles, which makes it the worst candidate for
 * silencing; noise is a real cost but the answer to it is a shorter line, not a
 * quieter one; and a silencing flag is a flag an agent running as the owner can
 * pass on the owner's behalf — the same failure `observe enable` avoids by
 * having no `--yes`. So the notice is **one line**, and it prints every time.
 *
 * ## What it proves, and what no type can
 *
 * {@link EgressNotice} is the brand `announceCapture`/`CaptureNotice` already
 * uses: minted by exactly one function, required by {@link dispatchAnnounced},
 * so a prompt cannot be handed to an off-machine backend by code that has not
 * first written the line — and `tsc` says so rather than a reviewer. It proves
 * the line was *written*. It cannot prove anybody read it, and
 * {@link EGRESS_LIMITS} says that out loud rather than leaving it implied.
 *
 * Three other things in this repo talk about egress and none of them covers
 * this one: `egressNote` (`src/soul/apply.ts`) and `verifyEgressNote`
 * (`src/soul/verify.ts`) are about the *soul file* being uploaded, and verify's
 * is printed after its own turns; `LOCAL_LIMITS` is about how little "loopback"
 * proves. This one is about the owner's prompt, before it goes.
