 * the only record of which backends received that text. Delete them first and
 * the owner has destroyed the evidence they would have needed to decide
 * whether deleting was enough. So the backends are printed from the matched
 * lines, every time, including on the run that actually deletes.
 *
 * **Say what deletion does not reach.** Printed every time too, not filed in
 * a document somebody might read. A promise of erasure that quietly excludes
 * the vendor's copy, the filesystem snapshot and the shell history is worse
 * than no promise, because the owner acts on it.
 *
 * Like `soul apply`, a dry run is the default and `--yes` is the whole
 * difference between the two code paths.
