/**
 * The autonomy dial — and the sentence a reader of its name will get backwards.
 *
 * ## Read this before anything else in this directory
 *
 * **The dial does not add safety. It is the key that takes safety off.**
 *
 * Every `headlessArgv` in `src/exec/registry.ts` splices {@link
 * import("../exec/registry.ts").readOnlyArgs} into the command line
 * *unconditionally* — six vendors, six call sites, no branch between the
 * declaration and the argv. Measured on 2026-09-22 against the tree at `97fb8d2`:
 * every turn om-agi has ever started already carries whatever read-only flag
 * its vendor offers. So the starting state of this program is the *restrained*
 * one, and `DEFAULT_DIAL` — every category at 1 — is not an intention waiting to
 * be implemented. It is a description of what already happens.
 *
 * What is new is the ability to **turn that off**, at level 2 and above. A
 * reader who arrives at a file called `autonomy.ts` expecting a safety feature
 * will read every default here as timid and every raise as progress, and will be
 * wrong in the one direction that costs something. The backlog calls S5.1
 * *"คุมได้ว่าเรื่องไหนทำเองได้"* — control over what it may do by itself — and
 * control is bidirectional. This file is the loosening half.
 *
 * ## Four categories, one lever
 *
 * AC2 asks for four: read, write, run, reach. D-002 (om-agi borrows vendor CLIs
 * rather than owning a sandbox) means the lever that really exists is **one bit
 * per turn**: the vendor's read-only flag is on, or it is not. Four numbers
 * therefore have to collapse into one decision, and the collapse is
 * {@link actLevel} — a **minimum**, never a maximum.
 *
 * Minimum, because `reach` is capped at 2 by its own type ({@link ReachLevel},
 * S8.3 AC2 / I-6). Under a maximum, setting `write = 3` would drag the acting
 * level to 3 and `reach` would be at 3 by arithmetic while its type still said
 * `0 | 1 | 2` — the guard would lose without anything printing a word. Under a
 * minimum, the flag comes off only when **all three** of write, run and reach
 * are at 2 or more, so raising `reach` is the single door, which is exactly
 * where I-6 wants the door to be.
 *
 * The cost of a minimum is its own kind of lie: a `write = 3` that does nothing
 * because `reach` is 1. That is why {@link import("./effective.ts").effectiveDial}
 * reports every clamp it applies and `ohmyagi autonomy set` prints them **at the
 * moment of setting**. A dial that quietly divides your number by something is
 * still a dial that lies; it just lies with arithmetic instead of with silence.
 *
 * ## `read` cannot be separated, and says so
 *
 * There is no vendor flag that means "may read, may not write". claude's
 * mechanism is `--tools ""`, an empty allow list that removes the read tools
 * too; codex's is `--sandbox read-only`, which reads freely. So `read` is kept
 * as a number because AC2 asks for four categories — the ACs are the owner's —
 * and every place it is printed carries `not separable` beside it rather than a
 * bare integer that implies a control nobody has.
