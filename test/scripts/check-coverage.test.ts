/**
 * The gate that watches every source file, watched.
 *
 * `scripts/check-coverage.ts` decides whether the test suite really runs the
 * code it loads, and until now it was the one file in this repository that
 * nothing checked — and could not be checked, because every line of it was
 * top-level: importing it from a test meant starting `bun test` from inside
 * `bun test`. The measuring now sits behind `import.meta.main` and the judging is
 * pure, so the three questions below can be asked of invented lcov rather than
 * of this machine.
 *
 * The one that matters most is the **malformed report**. A gate whose parser
 * quietly returns nothing must fail, not pass: bun could change its reporter,
 * the lcov could be truncated by a full disk, and an empty parse read as "no
 * file is below the floor" would print `all 60 source file(s) … 85%` over a suite
 * that measured nothing. That is the exact shape of failure this repository keeps
 * finding, and it is asserted here as its own test.
 *
 * The second is the **exemption list**. Eight files are excused from needing a
 * test on the words *"Checked, not assumed: every line of this file is
 * `export *`"* — checked once, by a person, in 2026. Now every run reads them.
 *
 * The third arrived with `bin/`. Thirteen files there run only in a process the
 * tests spawned, where bun measures nothing, so they are held at a recorded
 * size instead of a percentage. That list has the failure mode every second
 * list has: it describes a tree it does not live in, and it drifts. So the
 * numbers in it are checked against the files on **every `bun test` run**,
 * rather than only when somebody runs the gate — a ratchet nobody turns is a
 * number that was true once.
 *
 * The fourth arrived with `scripts/`, and brought two things worth naming.
 *
 * **`judge` used to be `main`.** 115 lines turning verdicts into an exit code,
 * reachable only by running the gate — so the largest untested thing in this
 * repository was inside the file whose job is to find untested things. It is
 * pure now, and what is tested below is not only each branch but their
 * **order**: absence before the floor, the `scripts/` registry before the size
 * ratchet. Reordering any pair changes which failure a person is shown first,
 * and two of the orderings are load-bearing rather than cosmetic.
 *
 * **`measure` takes the command it runs.** It is the one function here that
 * starts `bun test`, and it has no default, so the tests below hand it `bash`
 * and a `printf`. That is deliberate to the point of being the design: a
 * default would be a default nobody passes over, and the first test to call it
 * would have forked the suite inside itself.
