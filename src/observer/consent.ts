/**
 * The one decision om-agi will not make on the owner's behalf.
 *
 * ## Why this is not a flag
 *
 * D-024 and D-025 were technical calls, and the owner delegated those. Whether
 * a program may keep a record of what its owner does, minute by minute, is not
 * a technical call, and it cannot be delegated — not to om-agi and not to an
 * agent acting for the owner. So capture ships **off**, and turning it on costs
 * two deliberate acts: this command, and then connecting the hook by hand
 * (`observe hook --print` only prints).
 *
 * Three properties follow, and each of them exists because of a specific way
 * this could otherwise go wrong.
 *
 * - **There is no `--yes`.** Every other writing command in om-agi has one, and
 *   this one deliberately does not: an agent running as the owner can type
 *   `--yes` for them, and an agent is exactly who would. The acceptance is a
 *   phrase typed at a terminal instead.
 * - **The consent is to a sentence, not to a program.** {@link consentDigest}
 *   hashes the words that were shown. A release that changes what is captured
 *   changes the words, changes the hash, and capture stops until the owner has
 *   read the new list. Nothing needs to remember to ask.
 * - **The consent lives inside the observer directory.** So `observe purge` and
 *   `ohmyagi erase` remove it along with the records, without either of them
 *   being taught about this file. Deleting the data *is* withdrawing consent,
 *   and capture stops by itself (I-4).
 *
 * ## What the terminal check proves, and what it does not
 *
 * It proves there is a terminal. It does not prove there is a person: `script(1)`
 * gives any process a pty, and an agent with a shell can use it. That is the
 * same class of limit `OBSERVER_LIMITS` already admits about the capture notice
 * — a type can witness a call, not a reading — and it is written into
 * {@link CAPTURE_LIMITS} rather than left for a reader to work out.
