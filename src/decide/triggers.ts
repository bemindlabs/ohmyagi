/**
 * S5.3 — work that starts on a schedule rather than on a person (D-054).
 *
 * A trigger is a prompt and an interval, written in `triggers.md` beside
 * `autonomy.md`: in git, with the identity, so what an agent does by itself on
 * a timer is part of who it is and every addition is a line in `git diff`.
 *
 * Three things are deliberately not here:
 *
 * - **A daemon.** `ohmyagi triggers tick` runs what is due and exits; the OS
 *   decides when to call it (a systemd timer, cron). The non-goals say om-agi
 *   does not re-implement a scheduler, and a tick that has exited cannot hang.
 * - **A level.** A triggered turn is held at 1 — it proposes, it does not act —
 *   whatever the dial says (S5.2 AC1: anything not directly asked for comes out
 *   as a proposal). The caller does that with the existing ceiling, which can
 *   only lower a level.
 * - **Catch-up.** One timestamp per trigger. A machine that was off for a week
 *   fires a daily trigger once when it comes back, not seven times.
