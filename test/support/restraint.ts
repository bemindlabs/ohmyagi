 * test helper that exempted itself would have written the bypass it is there to
 * prevent. Everything here goes through `effectiveDial` and `restrain`, so a
 * test asking for level 2 gets level 2 by the same arithmetic a turn does —
 * including the minimum, which is why every category is set together.
