/**
 * Level 1 means *propose*: the agent says what it would do instead of doing it
 * — S5.2 AC1 (D-045).
 *
 * At level 1 every vendor already runs with its read-only flag, so nothing the
 * model decides to do can happen. What was missing is the other half: the
 * thing it *would* have done going somewhere a person can approve it. This
 * file is that half — the instruction the turn adds to the system prompt, and
 * the reader that turns what came back into proposals for the store S5.2
 * already has.
 *
 * The format is a fenced block with its own language tag, because it survives
 * every backend's markdown and is unambiguous to find: a model that writes
 * JSON in prose has not filed anything.
