/**
 * `ohmyagi autonomy` — S5.1, and the command that has to say which way it points.
 *
 * Somebody who types `ohmyagi autonomy set write 2` is not adding a safeguard.
 * They are taking one off: every vendor's read-only flag has gone onto every
 * turn unconditionally since long before this command existed, and 2 is the
 * level at which om-agi stops sending it. Every path through this file says so,
 * out loud, in the output — not in a comment, not in a document — because the
 * name of the command teaches the opposite.
 *
 * Three things are said **at the moment of setting** rather than later, and each
 * of them is a lie the dial could otherwise tell:
 *
 * 1. **The number that will be ignored.** A turn runs at `min(write, run,
 *    reach)`, so `write = 3` with `reach = 1` does nothing at all. That is
 *    printed as a clamp, with both numbers and the reason, by `sayDial`.
 * 2. **The vendor that cannot honour the level.** A vendor that declares no
 *    read-only mechanism is refused at level 1 rather than run hopefully, and the
 *    person setting the level is told while they are setting it. kimi was that
 *    vendor until S12.6 gave it a profile file (D-120); none is today, and the
 *    sentence comes back by itself the day one is declared.
 * 3. **The flag that a `documented` reading rests on.** gemini's read-only claim
 *    comes from its own `--help` and no turn here has watched it hold. That
 *    sentence comes from `readonlyLimits()` — the one `ohmyagi backends` already
 *    prints — rather than from a second copy written for this command.
