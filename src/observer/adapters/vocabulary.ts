 * Which tool names mean "a file was edited" and which mean "a command ran" —
 * per vendor, in one place.
 *
 * `docs/cli-matrix.md` already records that copying an allowlist from one
 * vendor to another does not work: claude says `Edit` and grok says
 * `search_replace`, and a filter written against the wrong spelling silently
 * matches nothing. The same is true of a classifier, and the failure is worse
 * here because it is not silent-and-empty but silent-and-wrong: an unrecognised
 * editing tool lands in `kind: "tool"` with no target, and the owner's most
 * characteristic behaviour — which files they touch — quietly stops being
 * recorded.
 *
 * So the lists are here rather than inside an adapter, both vendors' names are
 * in them, and nothing infers a kind from the shape of a name.
