/**
 * The one door data flagged `personal` may leave by, and how wide it really is.
 *
 * S3.5 AC4 as written says *data flagged `personal` must never leave this
 * machine — only a local model may be chosen*. The second half is the half
 * that can be built. The first is a claim about a machine, and this file is
 * code on that machine; the honest version of the criterion, and the one the
 * engine and the docs now state, is:
 *
 * > a `Personal<T>` reaches a backend through exactly one function,
 * > {@link runPersonal}, which only accepts a backend {@link asLocal} minted.
 * > That is an ollama talking to a loopback **literal**, or one of S12.1's
 * > local CLI variants on a turn whose endpoint, fence and kernel support were
 * > checked together.
 *
 * ## Why a type alone could never have done it
 *
 * `BackendKind` defines `"http"` as *"an HTTP endpoint on this machine **or a
 * reachable host**"*, and `OllamaExec` takes its host from `OLLAMA_HOST`
 * without checking it. So "ollama is the local backend" is a sentence that can
 * be false at run time, on a machine nobody has misconfigured on purpose —
 * `OLLAMA_HOST=http://gpu-box.internal:11434` is a normal thing to export.
 *
 * Locality is therefore a run-time fact, and a type can only ever hold
 * *evidence that it was checked*. That is exactly the pattern `SubjectId`
 * already uses: one constructor, one validation, a brand that means "this went
 * through it". {@link LocalBackend} is the same shape, and {@link asLocal} is
 * the only constructor.
 *
 * ## What `asLocal` accepts, and why each refusal
 *
 * - **A concrete implementation, by `instanceof`** — never by an id a wrapper
 *   can copy. `OllamaExec` is checked directly. A `LocalCliExec` also needs
 *   the request it is about to run, because its fence is a per-turn fact.
 * - **A loopback literal host** — `127.0.0.0/8` or `[::1]`. `localhost` is
 *   refused: it is a *name*, and a name is resolved by whatever `/etc/hosts`,
 *   NSS and the resolver say at the moment of the call.
 * - **A local CLI passes three checks at that moment** — its base URL is a
 *   loopback literal, the request fence allows only that URL's TCP port, and
 *   this kernel reports the Landlock and seccomp support needed to enforce the
 *   address/transport fence. D-123 opened this door in S12.7.
 * - **Everything else refused outright** — an ordinary `CliExec` reaches a
 *   cloud; a `FallbackExec` may end anywhere; a wrapper can copy an id.
 *
 * ## What this does not prove — stated here, in {@link LOCAL_LIMITS}, and
 * printed by `observe status`
 *
 * **Loopback is not the same thing as local.** `127.0.0.1:11434` can be an ssh
 * tunnel, a socat forward or a proxy, and om-agi cannot tell one from an
 * ollama. **An ollama can relay for you**: models whose names end `-cloud` are
 * served by the daemon forwarding the turn to a hosted endpoint, and from
 * inside this process that turn is indistinguishable from a local one.
 *
 * om-agi does **not** try to detect that, and the reason is a measurement
 * rather than an oversight. On 2026-09-21 the owner checked this machine's
 * ollama: it holds no `*-cloud` model at all, and `/api/show` for the local
 * models returns no field naming a remote or a host. A check written against
 * that shape could not have been fired once, and a guard that has never been
 * fired is a guard nobody knows the state of — which is the failure this whole
 * story is about. So the risk is declared and left visible instead.
