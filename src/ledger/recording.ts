/**
 * The seam where a turn becomes a line.
 *
 * A wrapper around one backend rather than a hook inside `FallbackExec`, for a
 * reason that is the whole design of S2.2: `run` is called exactly when a
 * prompt is really handed over. A backend the chain found `unavailable` never
 * had the text and gets no line; a chain that tried three backends and got an
 * answer from the third produces three lines only if three of them were
 * actually asked. "Who received this prompt?" is the question I-6 turns on,
 * and wrapping `run` is the only place where the answer is a fact rather than
 * an inference from the shape of the chain.
 *
 * Nothing here imports anything from `src/exec/` but types. The ledger must
 * stay provably free of network access (AC4), and a test walks this file's
 * import graph looking for exactly that.
