/**
 * Which backend a `--model` belongs to, and whether that backend can take one at all (D-142).
 *
 * A model is a fact about one backend, never about a turn. `opus` means something to claude and nothing to
 * ollama; `qwen3:8b` is the other way round. So a model is bound to the backend it was chosen for when that
 * backend is built (`backend(id, { model })`), and a fallback chain carries no model of its own — each step
 * runs the model it was given, or its own default.
 *
 * The command line says which step a model is for in one of two ways:
 *
 * - `--model <name>` — the chain's only backend; or, in a chain of several, its `ollama` step. That second rule is
 *   what `--model` always meant (`turn --model stub` with the default chain `claude → codex → ollama`), and it
 *   stays: a bare name in a chain of several never reaches a vendor CLI. A chain of several without ollama is
 *   refused, because which step was meant cannot be known.
 * - `--model <backend>=<name>[,<backend>=<name>…]` — each named step its own model. `=` and `,` never occur in a
 *   model name (`modelProblem`), so the two forms cannot be confused.
 *
 * Every model is checked before anything is sent: its shape, and that the backend takes one — the local CLI
 * variants run `local-coder` and nothing else, and a vendor without a {@link import("./registry.ts").ModelSpec}
 * has no flag om-agi has read off its `--help`. A refusal says so; nothing runs on a default in its place.
