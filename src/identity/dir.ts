/**
 * Where an agent's own signing key lives (S15.8, D-108, D-138) — the address alone.
 *
 * Apart from `key.ts` on purpose, the way `src/web/push-dir.ts` is apart from `push.ts`: the data map
 * (`src/erase/map.ts`) names this directory, and everything the map imports is read by `erase` and by
 * `deploy plan`, whose import closures hold no process, no socket and no key material. A `join` is all
 * either of them needs.
 *
 * `$XDG_DATA_HOME/om-agi/<subject>/identity/` — under the data root, beside `personal/` rather than in it
 * (D-138). The data root because a key cannot be made again: a new one is a different agent to everyone who
 * knew the old public key, which is the test D-014 uses for "data, not state". Beside `personal/` because
 * that tree is the owner's personal data — capture, proposals, needles — and a credential is not; the map
 * lists it as its own entry, so erase and deploy each name it.
