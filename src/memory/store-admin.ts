/**
 * The only door from `erase` to another program over a socket (D-038).
 *
 * `test/erase/no-network.test.ts` holds the erase layer to a rule: nothing it
 * can reach opens a socket, because a layer that deletes somebody's data and
 * could also send what it read would be the worst place in the program for a
 * leak (I-6). The `rag` place cannot keep that rule literally — its data lives
 * in Qdrant — so it keeps it the way the spawn chokepoint keeps the rule about
 * processes: **one file**, and that file can do very little.
 *
 * - Two methods: `GET` a collection's description, `DELETE` a collection.
 * - No request body, ever. The only thing that leaves is a URL built from a
 *   loopback address and {@link collectionFor}'s name — never a byte the erase
 *   layer read off disk.
 * - The address was checked with `notLoopbackLiteral` when it was resolved
 *   (`vectorEndpoints`, or the marker `memory index` left).
 *
 * `test/memory/store-admin.test.ts` asserts all three against the syntax tree.
