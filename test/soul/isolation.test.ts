/**
 * S1.6 AC2 — wear A, ask, switch to B, ask again, and get nothing of A back.
 *
 * This is the story's whole claim in one file, run end to end against the real
 * `apply` path: two synthetic souls with five disjoint facts each, a temporary
 * home with somebody's own `CLAUDE.md` already in it, and a backend that hands
 * back everything the channel carried.
 *
 * ## Why the oracle, and why it is not a weaker test
 *
 * `channelOracle` (`test/support/channel-oracle.ts`) reads its instruction file
 * and repeats it. That is the *leakiest* backend that could exist — a model
 * with no discretion at all — so "A's facts did not come back" here means they
 * were not reachable, not that something chose not to say them. A real model
 * would be a test of that model's mood on the day, and
 * `test/soul/isolation.real.test.ts` is the opt-in run for that.
 *
 * ## The control, which is half the evidence
 *
 * Before the switch, all five of A's facts come back. Without that, "B could
 * not answer" would be consistent with a question set that nothing can answer,
 * and the whole file would be green for the wrong reason.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the real `$HOME`: every path is under a temporary
 * directory, and the fixtures are synthetic (D-021).
