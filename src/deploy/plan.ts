/**
 * S13.1 — `ohmyagi deploy plan`: what would go where, before anything is done.
 *
 * D-100 widened I-6's "on this machine" to "on a machine the owner controls",
 * on four conditions: the disk there is encrypted with a key outside the
 * provider's place, `erase` reaches it, the machines talk over the tailnet or
 * ssh with no public port, and the first deploy waits for a typed phrase. Before
 * any of that is built (S13.2–S13.5), a person has to be able to see the whole
 * of it — every byte of theirs that would move, where it would land, what stays,
 * which of the four conditions this provider can meet and how, and every
 * command `apply` would run — and argue with it. That is this file.
 *
 * ## What it reads, and what it does not do
 *
 * It reads sizes off this disk (`readdir` and `lstat`, never the contents of a
 * place), the agent's `.git/HEAD` to know whether there is a commit to clone,
 * and whether the personal directory sits inside a repository. It writes
 * nothing, opens no socket and starts no process: every command in the plan is
 * an argv in a list, shown and never run. `test/deploy/no-network.test.ts`
 * walks this directory's import closure for a subprocess or a socket, and
 * `test/deploy/plan.test.ts` runs a plan with both taken away and counts the
 * tree before and after.
 *
 * ## One data map, evaluated twice
 *
 * The places are `erase`'s own (`src/erase/map.ts`, S7.1): evaluated with this
 * machine's roots they say where each thing is here, and evaluated with the
 * remote's roots they say where it would be there. The remote's paths are
 * therefore the ones the engine there resolves — the same functions — which is
 * also what lets D-100 #2 be met: `erase` run there finds every place.
 *
 * Everything personal lands on the encrypted volume: the agent's repository
 * (memory/ and the soul are in it), the state root and the data root, and the
 * home the services run with. Only the binary and the unit files are on the
 * boot disk, and neither holds anything of anybody's.
