/**
 * Writing an identity into files that belong to somebody else.
 *
 * Split into two functions that do not call each other. {@link planApply}
 * reads and decides; {@link commitApply} writes. A dry run — which is the
 * default (AC2) — is literally the absence of the second call, not a flag
 * threaded through a function that also knows how to write. There is no code
 * path where a mistake in argument handling turns a preview into a write.
 *
 * Everything this module knows about the machine arrives as an argument: home,
 * environment, clock, PATH lookup. That is not general-purpose tidiness. The
 * files at stake are the operator's live instruction files, read by the CLI
 * that is probably running this code, and a test that resolved the real `$HOME`
 * would be one typo away from editing them.
 *
 * What is protected, and how:
 *
 * - **A human's own text survives every write.** Before writing, the bytes
 *   outside om-agi's block in the *new* text are compared with the bytes
 *   outside the block in the text on disk. Not similar — equal. Anything else
 *   is refused with no write attempted (AC4).
 * - **The previous file is kept.** Every file that existed is copied, byte for
 *   byte, under a timestamped backup directory with a manifest, and the
 *   command to put it back is printed. S1.5 will automate that; until then a
 *   human with `cp` can undo this (backlog §7: *ห้ามตัด AC นี้*).
 * - **Nothing is written on a stale read.** The plan records a hash of each
 *   file; the commit re-reads and refuses the whole batch if any of them moved
 *   between the two. Another tool writing the same file mid-run is ordinary
 *   here, not exotic.
 * - **Switching identity leaves no residue.** Each file holds one block, so
 *   applying subject B replaces subject A's block whole, and the report names
 *   whose identity was displaced (AC5, D-011).
