/**
 * S5.4 AC3 — *test พิสูจน์ว่าหยุดได้จริงกลางงาน* — and AC2, which is the half
 * that decides how this file is written.
 *
 * AC2 says the kill switch must work **even when the main agent is stuck**, so
 * `ohmyagi stop` is run here as a **separate process** against a `turn` that is
 * still going. Nothing is shared between them but the filesystem, which is the
 * whole claim.
 *
 * The stub vendor is what makes the mid-flight moment observable: it waits, and
 * *then* writes a file. So `did-it` existing afterwards means the turn ran to
 * completion, and `did-it` never existing means it was stopped while it was
 * still running. That is a fact about a file, not about a clock.
 *
 * ## D-028 — nothing here is asserted against the machine's speed
 *
 * Every wait is `while (!condition) await sleep(…)` with a bound that exists to
 * catch a structural break, never a busy machine. The one number that is
 * genuinely load-dependent — how long the stop took — is **printed with the
 * load average** and asserted about by nothing.
 *
 * ## Nothing here touches the real home
 *
 * `HOME`, `XDG_STATE_HOME` and `XDG_DATA_HOME` are temporary directories in
 * every case, and the PATH holds one symlink to `bun` plus the stub. Every
 * process this file signals is one it started, through `om-agi`, in that
 * sandbox.
