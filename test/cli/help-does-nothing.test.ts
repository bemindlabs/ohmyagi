/**
 * **A command that is asked how does not do.**
 *
 * This file exists because of one measurement, taken on 2026-09-22 against the
 * tree E5 left behind. Somebody ran `ohmyagi stop` to find out whether the
 * command existed, then ran `ohmyagi stop --help` to find out how to use it —
 * and the second run **set the brake a second time**, on a real machine. It was
 * withdrawn and nothing was lost, but the shape of the failure is worth more
 * than the incident: `--help` is not in `stop`'s boolean list, so `parseArgs`
 * filed it as an option nothing reads, the positional list came back empty, and
 * `cmdStop` ran exactly as if it had been typed bare. Nothing was malformed
 * enough to refuse. The command that exists to stop a runaway was thrown by
 * somebody asking it how it worked.
 *
 * The same measurement, swept over every verb `bin/om-agi.ts` dispatches, found
 * `stop` was the only one — fourteen answered with a usage error and one acted.
 * That is not a reason to fix only `stop`: the next state-changing command will
 * be written by somebody who does not know this happened, so the rule is
 * enforced in front of the `switch`, once, and asked here about **every verb the
 * entry point dispatches** rather than about a list kept by hand.
 *
 * ## What makes this a guard rather than a claim
 *
 * The detector is *"the state root and the data root do not exist afterwards"*,
 * and a detector that cannot see a write would pass over a program that wrote
 * constantly. So the last describe block runs the same detector over `om-agi
 * stop` **without** `--help` and requires it to go the other way. Without that
 * control, every assertion in this file is as true of a broken sandbox.
 *
 * ## Nothing here touches the real home
 *
 * Every spawn gets its own temporary `HOME`, `XDG_STATE_HOME` and
 * `XDG_DATA_HOME`, and a PATH holding one symlink to `bun` — checked by
 * {@link expectNoVendorOn} to hold no vendor CLI, so nothing this file starts
 * can reach a network or an account.
