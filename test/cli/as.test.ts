/**
 * `--as <dir>` — the one flag that decides *whose identity* a command runs as.
 *
 * It is sugar over `<dir> --subject <id>`, and sugar is exactly where a wrong
 * answer is cheapest to produce and dearest to notice: every refusal below is a
 * command line where two things each name an identity, and the alternative to
 * refusing is picking one of them quietly. I-3 is the invariant — identities do
 * not bleed — and `--as` is the one place a directory name could become an
 * identity by accident, so the subject is read out of `role.md` and then the
 * whole soul is loaded *as* that subject, which is what makes `person.md` have
 * to agree.
 *
 * Called here rather than spawned. `test/cli/turn.test.ts` and
 * `test/cli/worn.test.ts` already run `--as` through the real CLI end to end;
 * what they cannot do is report which of these lines ran, because bun measures
 * nothing in a process it spawned — `bin/as.ts` read 11.51%. {@link expandAs}
 * takes an argv and returns one, touches no global, and reads only the files it
 * is pointed at, so the whole of it can be asked directly.
