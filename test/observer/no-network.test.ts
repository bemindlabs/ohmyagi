/**
 * S3.5 AC2, layers A and B — and the exact size of what they prove.
 *
 * **What is proven: no code in om-agi's observer path opens a socket.** Not
 * "it did not this time". The import closure that starts at `src/observer/`
 * contains no module that names a network global, imports a network module, or
 * can start a process — and a subprocess is a network stack with extra steps,
 * so "cannot spawn" is part of "cannot reach a network" rather than a separate
 * story.
 *
 * **What is not proven, and must never be claimed:** that observer data cannot
 * leave this machine. The files are mode 0700 under a 0700 directory, which
 * keeps out *other accounts*. It does not keep out a process running as the
 * owner — and `cli-exec` spawns exactly such a process for every ordinary
 * turn, an agent with its own shell and its own network tools. That limit is
 * written into `OBSERVER_LIMITS`, printed by `observe status`, and asserted
 * below so that deleting it breaks a test.
 *
 * ## Three layers, and this file holds two
 *
 * - **A. static, over the import closure** (here) — the AST, not a grep. A
 *   checker that matched `"node:net"` as text could not see
 *   `import net from "net"`, and the walk that found the files could not see
 *   `await import("./leak.ts")` until it read the tree as well.
 * - **B. traps inside the process** (here) — `fetch`, `WebSocket` and the
 *   `Bun` socket constructors are replaced, then the whole observer cycle runs
 *   through them. Its control calls `fetch` while the traps are up and
 *   requires that the call was recorded.
 * - **C. `strace` over the real CLI** (`no-socket.test.ts`) — the layer that
 *   matches the criterion's own words, and the only one that can see a socket
 *   opened and closed by something neither A nor B is looking at.
 *
 * Layers B and C run against the store S3.5 built. The capture that will fill
 * it is w4's, and the tripwire at the bottom of this file is how w4 finds out:
 * an export added to `src/observer/index.ts` that layer B does not exercise
 * turns this file red rather than quietly shrinking what B covers.
