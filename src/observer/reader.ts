/**
 * One pipe, two doors: the hook at the moment of the action, and the seed over
 * files that already exist.
 *
 * `S3.1 AC1` is a rule about *not writing two readers*, and it is worth stating
 * why it is an acceptance criterion at all rather than an implementation
 * preference. A second reader is a second answer to "what counts as an action",
 * and the two drift: one de-duplicates and the other does not, one skips
 * sub-agent work and the other keeps it, and the pile of records the owner ends
 * up with is a mixture of two opinions with nothing on the line to say which.
 *
 * So there is one function, {@link readInto}, and everything else is what it
 * takes as arguments:
 *
 * - **lines** — an `AsyncIterable<string>`. The hook hands it a single line
 *   read from standard input; the seed hands it {@link streamLines} over a
 *   663 MB directory, one line at a time (`S3.1 AC4`).
 * - **an adapter** — a pure function from a parsed line to records or to the
 *   reason there were none. One per format, in `adapters/`.
 * - **a sink** — where accepted records go. The hook appends; a test collects.
 *
 * ## Skipping and counting (AC2), and the report (AC3)
 *
 * A line that does not parse, a record the adapter does not recognise, a record
 * that is a duplicate of one already seen — none of these end the run. Each is
 * counted under a one-word reason and the run carries on, because the failure
 * this is guarding against is a single malformed line at 4 a.m. ending a seed
 * over seven weeks of history.
 *
 * The reasons are **words this program chose**, never text from the data. That
 * rule came out of SP-1 (guard 3): `JSON.parse` quotes the input it choked on,
 * so an exception message is a transcript excerpt wearing a diagnostic's
 * clothes. Here the data is the owner's own, so the rule matters more, not
 * less.
