/**
 * S13.1 — every external command `deploy apply` would run, as argv, run by nobody.
 *
 * D-002's rule for the whole engine holds here: om-agi borrows hands. It does
 * not speak Google's or Amazon's API; it runs the `ssh`, `gcloud` and `aws` the
 * owner already has, with the owner's own logins, and a plan is the list of
 * exactly those command lines — so a person can read what would be done in
 * their name before any of it is.
 *
 * ## Three things each step is careful about
 *
 * - **Secrets never appear in an argv.** A key goes on stdin, and the step says
 *   *what* arrives there (`stdin`) without holding it. An argv is visible in
 *   `ps` to every user on both machines, and in shell history if pasted.
 * - **Personal bytes go straight onto the encrypted volume.** The repository is
 *   streamed as a git bundle and the places as tar, each piped from a local
 *   command (`pipeFrom`) into a process on the far side that writes under the
 *   volume — never a copy parked on the boot disk first.
 * - **Every word a remote shell will read is checked.** `ssh host -- a b c`
 *   hands the far side one string to parse, so a word with a space or a `;` in
 *   it would be split or run. Every remote word is built from constants, the
 *   subject id and the target's validated name, and {@link remote} throws if
 *   one ever is not shell-plain — a programming error, not a user's.
 *
 * The provider-specific part is only the start: creating the machine (GCP, AWS)
 * or finding it (a VPS). From the first `uname -m` on, the steps are one
 * bootstrap for all three, which is what S13.3 and S13.4 say they reuse.
