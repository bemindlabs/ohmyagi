/**
 * What the owner **did**, counted — and the line between what may enter git and
 * what may not.
 *
 * ## There is no second extractor here
 *
 * `S3.2 AC1` asks for three kinds — a file edited, a command run, a tool called
 * — and w4 already built that: `kindOf` and `targetOf`
 * (`adapters/vocabulary.ts`) classify every record on the way in, and
 * `CaptureRecord` (`record.ts`) carries all of `AC2`'s fields — when, which
 * project, what kind, what target, did it work. A second classifier in this file
 * would be a second answer to "what counts as an action", and the two would
 * drift the way `reader.ts` explains two readers drift. So an {@link Action} is
 * a record whose kind is not `prompt`, {@link isAction} is the whole of the
 * selection, and everything else here is about what happens *after* a record.
 *
 * The grok `permission_resolved` decision kind that AC1 permits as an exception
 * is **not built**, and the reason is in {@link ACTIONS_LIMITS} rather than in a
 * comment nobody prints: grok has no hook, so its data can only ever arrive
 * through a seed, and no seed has been run on this machine. An extractor for a
 * record shape that does not exist yet is a mechanism that cannot be tested,
 * which is the failure this project has now met several times. It is task w5b.
 *
 * ## The line this file draws (the decision `S3.2 AC5` needed)
 *
 * AC5 asks for output that is readable and can go into git (I-2). w3 proved the
 * other half of that sentence: **what enters git cannot be taken back out**
 * (`GIT_UNDELETABLE`). So the split is not "filter the risky parts out" but
 * "make the risky parts unrepresentable":
 *
 * | may enter git | never enters git |
 * |---|---|
 * | integers | any string from a record |
 * | the month (`YYYY-MM`) | a timestamp |
 * | the kind, outcome, origin, vendor — closed unions in `record.ts` | `project`, `session` |
 * | a tool name from {@link BUILTIN_TOOLS} | a path, a `target`, an MCP server's name |
 * | a program name from {@link SUMMARY_PROGRAMS} | anything else, counted as `other` |
 *
 * That is enforced by `countPersonal` (`src/types.ts`), which builds its result
 * from a vocabulary the caller supplies from *outside* the box and looks keys up
 * rather than inserting them. A path cannot become a key here even if somebody
 * asks for one: {@link actionsVocabulary} is the only thing that decides what
 * keys exist, and every word in it comes from a literal list in this file or
 * from the *name of a capture file* — which is a month, and nothing else.
 *
 * An MCP server's name is the case worth stating on its own. `mcp__acme__thing`
 * carries a company, and often a person; SP-1's first privacy guard is about
 * exactly that. It is not on the built-in list, so it is counted as `other`.
