/**
 * The harness that proves a refactor changed nothing, proved.
 *
 * `scripts/cli-parity.ts` is the tool that measured `split1`'s claim. It did
 * not appear in the coverage report — not at 0%, but not at all — and it could
 * not have: it had no `import.meta.main`, so the first thing an `import` did
 * was read `--base` off the test runner's own command line, fail to find it,
 * and `process.exit(2)`, taking the suite with it. The proof tool was the one
 * file in `scripts/` nothing could check.
 *
 * The question asked of it here is **not** the one `bin/` is asked. A size
 * ratchet answers "did code arrive where nobody can see it", which is the right
 * question for a command and the wrong one for an instrument: this file can be
 * byte-for-byte identical and have stopped proving anything, the moment a
 * `case` lands in `bin/om-agi.ts` that its matrix never runs. Nothing about its
 * size moves. So it is asked two questions instead, and both are asked on every
 * `bun test` rather than when somebody remembers:
 *
 * 1. **Do the two controls still hold?** Answered by really running them — one
 *    scenario of `--selftest`, in a `mkdtemp`, measured at ~1.3 s. The full
 *    matrix is 381 invocations and ~16 s, which is the right price by hand
 *    (`npm run parity`) and the wrong one on every test run. Cutting it to one
 *    scenario keeps *both* controls, because the control is what would
 *    otherwise never run automatically at all.
 * 2. **Does the matrix still describe this CLI?** Answered statically: every
 *    `case` in `bin/om-agi.ts` is exercised, every fixture the matrix names is
 *    on disk, and control 2's needle is still a string the CLI prints. Each of
 *    those can rot with no change to this file, which is exactly why they are
 *    checked against `bin/` as it is today rather than written down.
 *
 * The judging parts are tested in-process, and the control on the guard is done
 * over the *text* of the file rather than by breaking it: mutating a gate and
 * running it is the ordinary way to prove it bites, and here running it means
 * `bun test` inside `bun test`.
