 *
 * `booleans` is needed for one reason: without it `--backend ollama` reads as a
 * positional and `--as` would refuse a command line that is perfectly fine. It
 * is the **same array** the command itself passes to {@link parseArgs},
 * imported rather than restated — these used to be two lists in two files kept
 * in step by hand, and the day they disagreed `--as turn --private` would have
 * parsed one way here and another way one function later.
 *
 * Each list still lives beside the command that owns it, so adding a flag to one
 * command cannot change how another is parsed; what moved is only the copy.
 * `test/cli/layout.test.ts` checks that they are the same arrays and not equal
 * ones, which a copy typed back in here would fail.
