/**
 * A child of `ohmyagi web` held to a deadline (D-152) — `/api/memory-ask` is the route that asks for one.
 *
 * The child is started as the leader of a process group of its own, so the signals reach it and whatever it
 * started in that group, and nothing of the server's. At the deadline the group gets SIGTERM, which `memory
 * ask` answers by ending its backends; if the group is still there {@link ASK_KILL_GRACE_MS} later it gets
 * SIGKILL. Without the second step a child that ignored SIGTERM would hold the route's one-ask-per-agent slot
 * for good, and the 504 would never come. Resolves only once the child has exited.
