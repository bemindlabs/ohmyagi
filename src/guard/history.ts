/**
 * What git keeps after somebody deletes a file — said before the commit, not
 * after the regret.
 *
 * `ledger forget` already carries this shape: {@link UNDELETABLE} in
 * `src/ledger/store.ts` is printed on every run, including the dry one, because
 * a promise of deletion that quietly excludes the vendor's copy is worse than
 * no promise. S0.4 AC5 asks for the same honesty about git, and the timing is
 * the part that matters: `erase` (S7.2) has not been written yet, and even when
 * it is, the moment to tell somebody that a commit is forever is *before* they
 * make it. So {@link GIT_UNDELETABLE} is printed by `ohmyagi new` and by
 * `ohmyagi guard status`, which are the two commands that run before the first
 * commit and after it.
 *
 * **That half of AC5 is closed as of S7.2 (w3).** `ohmyagi erase` prints this
 * same array — by importing it through `src/erase/places.ts`, which holds it by
 * reference on the `soul` place, so a test can assert `toBe` and a second copy
 * of the words cannot appear. The command also says what it did *not* search,
 * and git objects are the first line of that list: the commit count comes from
 * {@link historyFacts}, and the object database is never grepped, because a
 * zero there would need a history rewrite to become true and om-agi does not
 * rewrite history.
 *
 * Three moments now print this list rather than two: `ohmyagi new` (before
 * anything is committable), `ohmyagi guard status` (after), and every run of
 * `ohmyagi erase`, including the dry one.

 * What is knowable about a repository without asking anything on the network.
 *
 * A union, and the second arm is odd2's H3. This used to be one shape with a
 * `commits: number`, and `git rev-list` failing produced `commits: 0,
 * remotes: []` — the same answer as a repository that has neither. Three
 * callers read it; two of them happened to be protected by something else, and
 * the third printed `git 0 commit(s) · no remote configured` onto an erase
 * certificate.
 *
 * The dangerous direction is not the one it is easy to imagine. A directory
 * that is plainly no repository is caught by a dozen other things. What is not
 * caught is a **real repository, with history and a remote, that git refuses to
 * read**: a corrupt `.git/config` (measured: every git command exits 128), or
 * `safe.directory` declining a checkout owned by another uid, which is the
 * ordinary state inside a container or under `sudo`. `.git` is right there, so
 * every "is this a repository?" test passes — and the document then says zero
 * about a history that is not zero. A certificate that claims *less* than the
 * truth about what git kept is the exact failure S0.4 AC5 is written against.
 *
 * So "could not look" is a state of its own, and the compiler makes all three
 * callers deal with it.
 *
 * `no-git` is the third of those and arrived with dod1. Every arm above assumes
 * a `git` process ran and said something; on a machine with no git at all there
 * is no exit code to read, because the chokepoint in `src/spawn.ts` throws
 * before any child exists. That machine is not hypothetical — it is the bare container the MVP-lite DoD
 * is *defined* by, where `git` is on the forbidden list on purpose, and where
 * `ohmyagi erase --agent` therefore exited 1 with a stack trace and deleted
 * nothing at all. I-4 says a withdrawal must not claim more than it did; a
 * withdrawal that crashes before it starts fails that from the other side.

 * they already have, about a path they mistyped.

 *

 * configured" and 128 when it could not read the config. Collapsing either pair
 * is how the old shape reported zero for both.
