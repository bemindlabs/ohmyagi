/**
 * The fallback chain, tested without forking anything (S2.1 AC4).
 *
 * The CLI-level test for AC6 spawns a real `ohmyagi turn` against real stubs,
 * which is the right test for "does this work end to end" and the wrong one
 * for "what does the chain do when the second backend exits 0 empty" — a
 * subprocess does not appear in the coverage report, and arranging six
 * different miss shapes through the filesystem is slower and less exact than
 * saying so in a fake. So the fakes here are the seam AC4 asks for, and the
 * fakes are also what let the last case below exist at all: a chain where
 * every member misses, asserted to invent nothing.
