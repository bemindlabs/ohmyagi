/**
 * S3.5 AC4 — the one door, and an honest measurement of how wide it is.
 *
 * ## The criterion is narrowed on purpose
 *
 * As written, AC4 says *data flagged `personal` must never leave this machine —
 * only a local model may be chosen*. The first half is a claim about a machine,
 * and everything here is code running on it; nothing in this repository can
 * make it true, so nothing here will tick a box saying it did. What is built,
 * and what these tests check, is the half that can be:
 *
 * > a `Personal<T>` reaches a backend through exactly one function,
 * > `runPersonal`, which accepts only a backend `asLocal` minted — and
 * > `asLocal` mints only an `OllamaExec` whose host is a loopback **literal**.
 *
 * ## Why a type alone could not have done it
 *
 * `BackendKind` defines `"http"` as "an endpoint on this machine **or a
 * reachable host**", and `OllamaExec` reads its host from `OLLAMA_HOST` without
 * checking it. "ollama means local" is therefore a sentence that is false on a
 * machine nobody misconfigured on purpose. Locality is a run-time fact, so the
 * type can only ever hold *evidence that it was checked* — the shape
 * `SubjectId` already uses. Three tests below are that argument, executed:
 * `OLLAMA_HOST` pointing at another host is refused, `localhost` is refused
 * because it is a name, and a wrapper that copies the id `"ollama"` is refused
 * because an id is a string anything can copy.
 *
 * ## What is not proven — asserted here so that deleting it breaks a test
 *
 * `LOCAL_LIMITS` holds four sentences, and each is something a reader could
 * reasonably take "personal data cannot leave this machine" to include and
 * which this code does not deliver: loopback is not local (a tunnel or a proxy
 * passes), an ollama can relay (`*-cloud` models are forwarded by the daemon),
 * the flag stops at the door (an unwrapped string is a string), and a process
 * with the same uid can read the files directly.
