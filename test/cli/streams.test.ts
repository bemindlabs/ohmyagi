/**
 * Which stream a byte lands on — measured first, then enforced.
 *
 * Under bun 1.4.2 a `console` method called with **no arguments** writes its
 * lone newline to **stdout**, whichever stream that method is documented to
 * use. `console.error()` as a blank-line spacer therefore does two wrong things
 * at once: it appends a blank line to the output somebody is piping, and it
 * puts nothing at all in front of the message it was written to separate.
 *
 * This is not a claim taken from a changelog. {@link MEASURED} below spawns a
 * child per method and reads the two pipes, so the rule this file enforces is
 * exactly as wide as what was watched happen — `console.debug()` also lands on
 * stdout and is *not* banned, because stdout is where `debug` is supposed to go.
 * The day bun fixes this, the canary goes red and says so; the fix is to delete
 * the rule, not to re-green the canary.
 *
 * ## The rule, and how a spacer is decided
 *
 * stderr exists to carry a reason, so its first byte should be a reason. At a
 * spacer, look at what the same run has already written to stderr:
 *
 * - something already there → the blank line is a separator *within* stderr,
 *   and `console.error("")` is how to write it (with the argument, it really
 *   does go to stderr — asserted below);
 * - nothing there yet → the blank line was separating stderr from stdout on a
 *   terminal. That is the terminal's business and not the stream's, and the
 *   spacer is deleted.
 *
 * ## The second measured fact: a long write through a pipe, and a race
 *
 * Added by odd3, and it is about the same two streams. Under bun 1.4.2 on
 * Linux, **reading the `process.stdout` getter can change what that stream then
 * does**: after the read, one `console.log` longer than {@link SURVIVED} bytes
 * into a real pipe(2) can arrive cut to exactly that many bytes, silently, with
 * no error and no short write reported. `bin/shared.ts` read
 * `process.stdout.isTTY` at import, so every command was exposed —
 * `ohmyagi help | less` showed 8192 of its 17363 bytes and stopped just after
 * `erase`'s usage line — and no test could see it, because `Bun.spawn`'s
 * "pipe" is not a pipe(2) and delivers all 20001 bytes either way.
 *
 * **"Can", not "does", and that is the whole shape of it.** The same probe on
 * the same machine on 2026-09-22 came back whole 40 times out of 40 while the
 * machine was quiet — including under a CPU busy loop, and at every requested
 * size from 8000 to 65536 — and cut 15 times out of 15 while `npm test` was
 * running, and 15 out of 15 with half a dozen other bun processes about. So
 * 8192 is not a ceiling the runtime declares; it is how much got through before
 * the process ended, and whether anything is lost at all is a race that busy
 * machines lose. That makes it *worse* than a fixed limit, not better: it is
 * invisible to anyone who tries it once on an idle laptop and concludes there
 * is no problem, and it bites in CI and during a parallel run, which is to say
 * while somebody is working.
 *
 * It also decides what this file may assert. The two things that are true in
 * both conditions — `isatty(1)` and touching nothing deliver every byte — are
 * asserted. What the getter does is **measured and printed on every run, red or
 * green, with the machine's state beside it**, in the shape
 * `scripts/check-coverage.ts` prints the half of the repository it cannot see.
 * A test whose colour tracks the load average is a test people stop believing
 * inside a week, and red has to mean something broke, not that something might
 * have improved.
 *
 * What is known here is behaviour: nobody read bun's source, and no other OS or
 * bun release has been measured. If the printed report ever shows every run
 * whole under load, that is a prompt for a person to measure it by hand and
 * consider deleting the rule — not for this file to delete it.
 *
 * ## What the checker cannot see
 *
 * {@link bareConsoleCalls} matches the shape `console.<method>()` and nothing
 * else. An alias, `console["error"]()`, `.call`/`.apply`, the method passed as
 * a value, and a local binding named `console` are all invisible to it — each
 * one is *demonstrated* below rather than merely admitted, so the size of the
 * guard is a measured fact for whoever reads it next. Compile-time enforcement
 * was considered and is not possible: declaration merging can add an overload
 * to `Console["error"]` but cannot withdraw the zero-argument one, and a
 * wrapper helper does not stop anybody from typing the original.

 * The two members of `process` no file under `bin/` or `src/` may read.
 *
 * `process.stdin` is **not** here: it was measured beside the other two and was
 * never seen to cost a byte, and `observe enable` genuinely has to ask whether
 * a person is at the keyboard. A rule wider than the measurement is a rule
 * people route around.
 *
 * Reading is the whole offence. `process.stdout.write` was not seen to lose its
 * own output — but reaching it means reading the getter, and a later
 * `console.log` in that process is then the one at risk. So the member access
 * is what is refused, not any particular call on it.
 *
 * The rule is wider than any single run's evidence on purpose. Whether the read
 * costs bytes depends on how busy the machine is, so "I tried it and it was
 * fine" is the expected result of trying it once and no reason to read the
 * getter: see the report the canary above prints on every run.
