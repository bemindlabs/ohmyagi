/**
 * Where a captured action lands, and how it comes back.
 *
 * `$XDG_DATA_HOME/om-agi/<subject>/personal/observer/capture/YYYY-MM.jsonl`,
 * mode 0600 under a tree mode 0700, one JSON object per line. Plain files for
 * the reason the ledger uses plain files (`src/ledger/store.ts`): an owner with
 * `jq` can read every byte om-agi wrote about them without om-agi installed,
 * and an owner with `rm` can end it. That is what makes I-4 checkable by
 * somebody who does not trust this code.
 *
 * ## One append, and no lock
 *
 * The ledger takes a `mkdir` lock around every append, and that is right for
 * the ledger: one writer per turn, and a lost line is a turn nobody can look
 * back at. It would be wrong here. Hooks fire per tool call, several tools can
 * run concurrently, and `withLock` *throws* when the lock is held — so a lock
 * would turn "two tools finished at once" into "one of them was never
 * recorded", silently, which is the failure this project exists to refuse.
 *
 * So: `O_APPEND`, one `write()` per record, and a cap on the size of a record
 * so that the write stays inside what a filesystem will not interleave. The cap
 * is not a guess about POSIX guarantees — it is why `target` is bounded in
 * `record.ts` and why nothing here carries text. A record that somehow exceeds
 * it is refused rather than written torn.
 *
 * There is no `fsync`. The ledger's sync is there because "the turn happened
 * and was recorded" has to survive a power cut in that order; a capture record
 * is not a receipt for anything that left this machine, and an `fsync` per tool
 * call would put a disk flush in front of every command the owner runs.
 *
 * ## Coming back out flagged
 *
 * {@link readCaptured} returns a `Personal<T>`. Everything in this directory is
 * a record of what a person did, so it is on the far side of the door S3.5
 * built: a `Personal<T>` reaches a backend only through `runPersonal`
 * (`src/exec/local.ts`), which takes only a backend `asLocal()` minted. The
 * counting and the de-duplication happen *before* the flag goes on, because a
 * count is not the owner's data — the records are.
