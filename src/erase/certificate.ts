/**
 * AC2 — the certificate: what, how many records, when, and who asked.
 *
 * ## Issued, never kept
 *
 * The certificate is printed to stdout, and written to a file only when
 * `--out` says where. om-agi retains no copy of its own, and the reason is the
 * same one that made `commitForget` remove its files rather than leave a
 * tombstone: a record saying *subject X existed and was erased on this date* is
 * itself a trace of the thing somebody asked to have removed. Worse, a stored
 * one would sit inside the state root, where the very next run's AC3 search
 * would find the subject id and report it as a remainder. A certificate that
 * fails the check it certifies is not a certificate.
 *
 * `--out` is refused inside the state root or the data root for exactly that
 * reason, and the refusal happens in the command, before anything is deleted.
 *
 * ## "ใครสั่ง", honestly
 *
 * Two fields, and they are labelled differently because they are different
 * kinds of thing. `claimed` is whatever `--by` said; om-agi authenticates
 * nobody and does not pretend to. `observed` is the OS account the process ran
 * as, which is a fact about this machine and not about a person. The
 * certificate says both of those sentences out loud, so that nothing here reads
 * as an attestation of identity.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately absent
 *
 * No hash of anything that was deleted. A hash of a short prompt, a name or an
 * address is guessable by anybody holding a word list — the reasoning that
 * keeps `--private` from storing one — and a "proof of what was removed" that
 * leaks what was removed is a poor trade.
 *
 * No needle text either. `--needle` counts appear; the text never does.
 *
 * ## What the document has to be able to say, and could not at `@1`
 *
 * A `@1` certificate's whole verification section is four numbers that read
 * zero when everything was cleaned and zero when nothing was ever there, beside
 * `ran: true` — which means only that {@link import("./plan.ts").verifyErase}
 * was *called*. A reader holding one cannot tell a withdrawal from a misfire.
 * `@2` adds three things and they are the answer to that: {@link
 * EraseCertificate.statement}, the sentences for this verdict in plain words;
 * `found` and `removed`, so a claim of erasure is beside the evidence for it;
 * and `filesRead`, per scope, so a zero says over how much.

/**
 * The schema tag every machine-readable certificate carries.
 *
 * `@2` was fix1, and the bump was not additive politeness: the verdict
 * vocabulary narrowed. Every `@1` document reading `erased-and-verified` was
 * issued by an engine that would also have said it over a subject it never
 * found, so the same words do not mean the same thing under the two tags.
 *
 * `@3` is fix2, and it is the same kind of narrowing one field over. Under `@2`
 * a `commits: 0` beside an empty `remotes` was issued for a repository with no
 * commits **and** for one git refused to read (odd2 H3): a document that said
 * *less* than the truth about what git is keeping, which is what S0.4 AC5 is
 * written against. Under `@3` that number is `null` whenever it was not
 * counted, and {@link EraseCertificate.agent}'s new `history` field says which
 * of the four reasons it is. D-026 item 6 is the rule being followed here, and
 * it is followed even though `@2` is a day old: a tag nobody can date a meaning
 * to is worth nothing, and a rule that bends for a convenient case is not one.
 *
 * `@4` is dod1, and it adds a **fifth** value to that field — `no-git`, for a
 * machine with no git on it — without changing what any of the four already
 * mean. By the letter of D-026 item 6 ("bump when a verdict's meaning narrows")
 * this would not need a tag at all, and that is the rule being too narrow
 * rather than this bump being ceremonial. The rule it is read as here:
 *
 * > **Bump when a reader written against the old tag could mishandle a new
 * > document.** Narrowing a verdict is one way that happens. Adding a value to
 * > a field somebody switches on is another: a reader that handled all four
 * > states of `@3` meets a fifth it has no arm for, and the state it cannot
 * > read is precisely the one that says *there may be history here nobody
 * > counted*.
 *
 * The cost is one line and the alternative is teaching ourselves that this rule
 * is negotiable when the last bump was recent — which is the thing D-027 and
 * D-028 both say a discipline must not be.
