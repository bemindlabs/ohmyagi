/**
 * What a task's turns are asked, and how their answers are read (D-154): plan, step, observe, decide next.
 *
 * Every step is an ordinary turn: these are only its prompt. The soul, recall, the dial, the fence, egress and
 * the ledger are the turn's business, exactly as for a message typed into the chat.
 *
 * The model reports at the end of each answer in one fenced block, `om-agi-task`, holding JSON — the same shape
 * of contract as D-045's `om-agi-proposal`. A block that cannot be read is said to be unreadable, never guessed
 * at: the step's summary is then the start of the answer, and three in a row end the task (the model is not
 * following the format, and another turn is unlikely to help).
