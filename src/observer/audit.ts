/**
 * The instrument `S3.2 AC4` needs, and the number it deliberately does not
 * produce by itself.
 *
 * AC4 reads *ตรวจมือ 20 ไฟล์สุ่ม — แม่น ≥ 80%* and carries its own status:
 * **⏳ ยังไม่ได้ตอบ**. SP-1 could say the data is there; it could not say the
 * reading of it is right. Nothing in a test suite can either, because every
 * record a test uses was invented by the test — a percentage over fixtures
 * measures this file, not the extraction.
 *
 * So what is built here is the thing that lets a person answer it in an
 * afternoon, and nothing that pretends to have answered it:
 *
 * - {@link sampleActions} picks up to twenty transcript files at random, derives
 *   records through the **same adapters a seed uses** (never a second reader —
 *   that is `S3.1 AC1`), and hands back pairs of *the line as the vendor wrote
 *   it* and *the record om-agi made of it*.
 * - {@link judgeSample} shows each pair and takes `y`/`n` per field, at a
 *   terminal, from a person.
 * - {@link formatAudit} prints judged, correct and the percentage per field,
 *   against {@link AUDIT_FLOOR}.
 *
 * Three properties are worth naming because each is a way this could quietly
 * become useless:
 *
 * 1. **It writes nothing.** No capture, no consent, no store — it reads the
 *    vendor's files and prints. That is why it can be run before capture is ever
 *    enabled, which is what makes AC4 answerable for the seed path on the day
 *    this lands.
 * 2. **`origin` is not judged.** A transcript cannot answer "who set this
 *    going", which is the whole of `S3.2 AC3` and the reason D-024 moved capture
 *    to a hook. Asking a human to grade a field whose only honest value is
 *    `unknown` would manufacture agreement.
 * 3. **It needs a terminal and has no `--yes`.** Same reason `observe enable`
 *    has none: a program running as the owner can type `y` a hundred times, and
 *    a percentage produced that way is a measurement of nothing.
