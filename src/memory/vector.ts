/**
 * The semantic half of recall — `bge-m3` on the real Ollama, and one Qdrant
 * collection per subject (D-007, D-038).
 *
 * ## Two endpoints, both loopback literals
 *
 * The text of an agent's memory leaves the om-agi process twice: to be
 * embedded, and as a payload beside its vector. Both endpoints are held to the
 * rule `asLocal` holds a turn to (`src/exec/local.ts`): a loopback **literal**,
 * never a name. D-038 measured why the embed endpoint is `:11435` and not the
 * `:11434` everything else on this machine uses: that port is a shim that
 * forwards to LiteLLM and replaces a model name it does not know with a
 * different model, silently. A recall built on vectors from a model nobody
 * asked for is wrong in a way no test here would see.
 *
 * ## What this client cannot do, on purpose
 *
 * It has no call that deletes points. D-035 measured Qdrant 1.18.2 keeping the
 * bytes of 96% of a collection's points on disk after they were deleted by
 * filter, so the only removal om-agi offers is `dropCollection` in
 * `store-admin.ts` — the whole collection, whose directory Qdrant does remove.
 * `test/memory/store-admin.test.ts` goes red if a per-point delete path appears in
 * any file under `src/memory/`.
