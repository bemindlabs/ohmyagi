/**
 * Q4-D2, option A (D-163, the owner's choice on 2026-10-06): **a turn on a backend that is not kernel-fenced
 * does not run with write or run at 2 or above.** Its write and run are held at 1 — propose only — until a
 * proper fence for cloud vendors exists. This file is a policy layer; the fence itself is `fence.ts`.
 *
 * Why: the owner's uid is in the `docker` group, which is root-equivalent. A loosened turn with no kernel
 * fence can reach `/var/run/docker.sock`, the systemd user bus and tailscaled. Only a turn inside the D-118
 * fence (claude-local, grok-local) cannot.
 *
 * ## The choke point
 *
 * Every entry — the CLI turn, the web `/api/turn`, a task's steps, chat, triggers, an approved proposal —
 * starts `ohmyagi turn` as a process, and `bin/commands/turn.ts` is the only place a loosened `Restraint` is
 * made and the only place a chain is built from it. It wraps each backend it builds in {@link CappedExec}, so
 * the cap is applied once, per backend, immediately before the request reaches that backend's own `run`. No
 * caller keeps a copy of the rule, and a backend added later is wrapped by the same line.
 *
 * ## What counts as fenced
 *
 * Not a list of names. {@link ExecBackend.appliesFence} is asked of the backend itself, about this very
 * request: `CliExec` answers true only when the request carries the fence it will hand the kernel;
 * `LocalCliExec` answers from its real `prepare()`. A backend that does not implement it is not fenced
 * (fail closed), so a new backend is capped by default.
