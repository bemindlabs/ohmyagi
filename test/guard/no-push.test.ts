/**
 * S0.4 AC2 — and the exact size of what it proves.
 *
 * **What is proven: no code path in om-agi pushes.** Not "it did not push this
 * time" — the argv of every subprocess in the engine is checked against a
 * closed allowlist before it runs, there is only one place in `src/` and `bin/`
 * that can start a process at all, and a `git` standing in for the real one
 * watches what actually executed.
 *
 * **What is not proven, and must never be claimed:** that a push cannot happen
 * on a machine running om-agi. Three holes stay open on purpose, and they are
 * written into `GUARD_LIMITS`, into ADR 0002 and into the guard's own output
 * rather than only here:
 *
 * 1. `cli-exec` spawns vendor CLIs, and a vendor CLI is an agent with its own
 *    shell tool. It can run `git push` inside its own process and nothing in
 *    this repository can see that happen.
 * 2. `--no-verify` skips the hooks, and so does anything that writes objects
 *    without running them.
 * 3. `.git/hooks` is not cloned, so a fresh clone has no guard until
 *    `ohmyagi guard install` is run there.
 *
 * An acceptance criterion that promised more than the layers below check would
 * be ticked and would mislead whoever read the tick. So the criterion is the
 * narrow one, and this file is what it means.
 *
 * ## Three layers, each with a control that proves it bites
 *
 * - **A. static, over the AST** — not a regular expression. The gate this
 *   replaces matched the text `Bun.spawn(["…"` and therefore could not see
 *   `Bun.spawn(argv)` in `cli-exec.ts`, which is the call that spawns vendor
 *   CLIs. The control feeds the checker source it must catch (`const b = Bun`,
 *   `Bun["spawn"]`, `node:child_process`) and source it must not (the same
 *   words in a comment).
 * - **B. policy** — `refusal()` is pure, so the argument about what om-agi may
 *   run happens in a unit test rather than through a subprocess.
 * - **C. behaviour** — every CLI command that takes an agent directory runs
 *   with a trap `git` first on PATH and a `file://` bare repository configured
 *   as a remote. Afterwards the trap's log holds no network verb and the bare
 *   repository holds no ref. Two controls: a push through the trap is caught,
 *   and a push without the trap really does land a ref — which is what makes
 *   "the bare repository is empty" a falsifiable claim rather than a tautology.
 *
 * Layer C only means something because layer A pins `dependencies` to empty:
 * with no libgit in the tree, the only way to write a ref into that bare
 * repository is to execute the `git` binary, and the binary on that PATH is
 * the trap.
