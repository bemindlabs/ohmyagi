/**
 * The one shape a captured action has, whichever door it came in through.
 *
 * ## Why there is a schema here at all
 *
 * D-024 turned E3 from a dig into a capture: claude keeps seven weeks and grok
 * keeps eleven days, so the record written at the moment something happens is
 * the only copy there will ever be. That makes this file the narrowest part of
 * the whole story — everything an owner will ever be able to ask about their
 * own behaviour has to fit through it, and everything that fits through it is
 * something they will later have to be able to delete.
 *
 * So the schema is deliberately small, and the two halves of that smallness are
 * different decisions:
 *
 * - **What is here** is what `S3.2 AC2` asks for: when, which project, what
 *   kind, what target, did it work. Plus the field the transcripts cannot give
 *   at all (`origin`), which is the entire reason D-024 moved this to a hook.
 * - **What is not here** is prompt text, tool output, file contents, and diffs.
 *   `S3.1 AC5` says metadata and event, not a copy of the transcript. A
 *   capture that held the text would be a second transcript in a directory the
 *   owner believes holds counters.
 *
 * ## `target`, and the decision that shrank it
 *
 * The plan for w4 proposed keeping a command's whole line, capped at 512
 * characters, with the pre-commit secret scan as the safety net. The owner
 * decided otherwise, and the reasoning is worth keeping next to the code: a
 * command line is where secrets and personal data most often sit — a header
 * carrying a token, a path carrying somebody's name, a prompt passed as an
 * argument — and `SCAN_BLIND_SPOTS` (src/guard/scan.ts) states in its own first
 * line that no rule there can see personal data written as prose. Leaning on it
 * would have been leaning on something whose documentation says it does not
 * hold.
 *
 * So `target` is split by kind instead:
 *
 * | kind | what is kept |
 * |---|---|
 * | `file-edit` | the path, relative to the project root — the real behavioural signal S3.2 AC2 wants |
 * | `command` | the program name and its first subcommand: `git commit`, `docker restart` |
 * | `tool`, `prompt` | nothing. The tool's own name is already in `tool` |
 *
 * That is a trade, not a free win: resolution is exchanged for a smaller leak
 * surface, and anyone who needs full argv has to design a separate consent for
 * it rather than getting it as a side effect of this one. {@link CAPTURE_LIMITS}
 * in `consent.ts` says so where an owner will read it.
