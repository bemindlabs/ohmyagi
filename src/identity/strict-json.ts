/**
 * JSON read the way a signature needs it read: strictly, and refusing a member name twice in one object
 * (S15.8 security review, L5).
 *
 * `JSON.parse` keeps the last of two members with one name. RFC 8785 forbids duplicates outright, and for a
 * signed document the difference is the whole point: `{"rows":[…unsigned…],"rows":[…signed…]}` verifies under
 * `JSON.parse`, while a reader that keeps the first sees the unsigned rows as if they were signed. So signed
 * text is parsed here, and a duplicate anywhere is a refusal rather than a choice.
 *
 * RFC 8259 exactly: no comments, no trailing commas, no leading zeros, no raw control characters in strings,
 * whitespace only where the grammar allows it. Objects are made the way `JSON.parse` makes them — plain
 * objects with own enumerable properties, `__proto__` included as a property rather than a prototype — so a
 * value read here compares equal to one `JSON.parse` would give. Nesting is limited, so hostile input cannot
 * exhaust the stack. Pure, and it never throws.
 *
 * ## Numbers are written one way only (D-141 §4)
 *
 * Everything om-agi signs holds integers and nothing else (D-138), and the canonical form of an integer is its
 * plain decimal digits. So a number is accepted only as that form: `0`, or an optional `-` and digits that do not
 * start with `0`, of magnitude at most 2^53 − 1. Refused, although RFC 8259 allows them and they parse to the
 * same value: a fraction (`1.0`, `1.5`), an exponent (`1e3`, `1E3`, `1e+0`), `-0`, and an integer beyond 2^53 − 1
 * (which no longer reads back as the digits written); `01` and `+1` are refused by the grammar itself.
 *
 * Before this, `"usd_micros":151250.0` and `1.5125e5` verified — the value was equal, so the signature over its
 * canonical form matched — and two texts that are one signed report to om-agi could be two different reports to
 * a reader that keeps what it was given. Refusing every other spelling means a signed number has one text —
 * numbers only: strings keep their JSON escapes and whitespace is free, so dedupe on decoded values, never on
 * the raw text. The platform's verifier holds itself to the same rule.
 *
 * Every caller reads integers only: a signed envelope (`report.ts`, `proof.ts`) and the owner's price file
 * (`src/pricing/table.ts`), whose rates are whole micro-dollars and end up in signed rows. Nothing that
 * legitimately holds a fraction may read through here; `JSON.parse` is for that.
