/**
 * The full-text half of recall — SQLite FTS5 with the `trigram` tokenizer
 * (D-037).
 *
 * Why this exists beside the vector store: a semantic search misses the things
 * a person searches for by exact spelling — a ticket number, a file name, a
 * port — and an ordinary FTS tokenizer cannot cut Thai, which has no spaces
 * between words. `trigram` indexes every three-character window, so it needs
 * no word boundaries at all. The price is that a query shorter than three
 * characters cannot use the index; {@link searchFts} falls back to a scan for
 * those rather than returning nothing.
 *
 * ## Where the file lives, and why it can always be thrown away
 *
 * `<agent>/.dagi/index/fts.sqlite`. Under `.dagi/`, which D-014 says must be
 * deletable at any moment and rebuilt from git, and which `erase` removes whole
 * in both scopes. {@link buildFts} writes a new file beside the old one and
 * renames it into place, so a reader never sees half an index and a failed
 * build leaves the previous one standing.
