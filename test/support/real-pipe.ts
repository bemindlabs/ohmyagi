/**
 * Run the CLI with its stdout on a **pipe(2)**, the way a person's shell does.
 *
 * Every other test in this repository, and `scripts/cli-parity.ts` with it,
 * starts the engine with `Bun.spawn({ stdout: "pipe" })`. Measured under bun
 * 1.4.2, that is not the same thing as a shell pipeline: one program printing
 * 20001 bytes in a single `console.log` arrives whole through `Bun.spawn` and
 * can arrive **cut to 8192 bytes, with no error anywhere**, through
 * `sh -c '… | cat'` — but only once something in the process has read
 * `process.stdout`. `bin/shared.ts` read `process.stdout.isTTY` at import, so
 * every command was exposed and no test could see it.
 *
 * "Can", because it is a race a busy machine loses rather than a fixed ceiling:
 * the same probe was measured whole 40/40 on a quiet machine and cut 15/15 on
 * the same machine beside other bun processes. `test/cli/streams.test.ts` has
 * the numbers and prints a fresh set on every run.
 *
 * So the pipe here is a real one. The child's stdout is the write end of a
 * pipeline whose reader is `cat`; what `cat` forwards is what this returns.
 *
 * ## Why the exit code needs a file
 *
 * A pipeline's status is the status of its *last* command, and `cat` almost
 * never fails. `pipefail` is bash, and `/bin/sh` here may be dash. So the
 * left-hand side writes `$?` — the engine's own code, taken before anything
 * else runs — to a file this function then reads. The alternative, printing it
 * on one of the two streams, would put a byte in the output being measured.
 *
 * ## `sh` and `cat` are required, and their absence is red
 *
 * Not skipped. A guard that quietly opts out on a machine without `cat` is a
 * guard that is not running, which is the state this whole file exists to end.
 * {@link runThroughPipe} throws a message that says *which* tool is missing, so
 * a red run on such a machine is not mistaken for a red run about the engine.
