/**
 * AC4 — no network egress on the ledger path, proven two ways.
 *
 * Running the code and watching for a socket would only show that nothing
 * happened to open one this time. So the first and stronger check is
 * structural, in the same shape as `test/agent/no-vendor.test.ts`: walk the
 * import closure of `src/ledger/` and look for anything that could reach the
 * network or spawn a process. Not "it did not" — **it cannot, because nothing
 * in the graph knows how.**
 *
 * A scanner that finds nothing is worthless without a control, so the same
 * scanner is pointed at `src/exec/`, where it must find `fetch` in the ollama
 * backend and `Bun.spawn` in the CLI backend. If the control ever comes back
 * clean, the scan above is meaningless and this file says so.
 *
 * The second check is behavioural and covers what a source scan cannot: an
 * indirect call through something that does not look like a network primitive.
 * `globalThis.fetch` is replaced with a function that throws, and a full
 * append/query/forget cycle is run against a temporary state directory.
 *
 * This matters more here than anywhere else in om-agi. The ledger is the one
 * place conversation is written down, which makes it the most valuable thing
 * on disk to anything that wanted to send data out (I-6).
