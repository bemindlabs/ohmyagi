/**
 * Reading a soul off disk, for exactly one subject.
 *
 * No cache, no module-level state, no "current" soul. om-agi wears identities
 * rather than having one (D-011), and a cache keyed by directory is how the
 * identity you loaded last starts answering for the identity you asked for
 * (I-3). Loading twice is cheap; loading the wrong subject is not.
 *
 * The subject is an argument *and* is checked against both files, which is the
 * point: a directory name is a hint, the `subject` key is the claim, and the
 * argument is the question. All three have to agree.
