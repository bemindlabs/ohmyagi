/**
 * "soul" is three locations on this machine, and this file is the evidence.
 *
 * The finding that shaped w3: `soul apply` writes an identity into more places
 * than the directory it read it from. Removing `<agent>/soul/` and stopping
 * would leave two working copies of the thing somebody just asked to have
 * deleted — the block inside every vendor instruction file, and the *backups*
 * om-agi itself took before those writes, in which a later backup contains the
 * block an earlier apply wrote. The test at the bottom of this file is the one
 * the owner asked for: prove all three go, rather than believing it.
 *
 * Two properties are worth more than the mechanism:
 *
 * - **Somebody else's file survives.** The block is delimited; `strip` is
 *   `apply`'s own inverse and this module calls it rather than writing a second
 *   remover. A block whose body was edited by hand refuses, and the refusal
 *   stops the run — S1.5 `soul revoke` is specified to reuse the same function,
 *   so there will never be two answers to "what does removing a block mean".
 * - **Another identity's block is not touched** (I-3). Only markers that name
 *   this subject are removed, and the file holding somebody else's is byte
 *   identical afterwards.
