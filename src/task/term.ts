/**
 * S18.1 — what a task's runner does when it is sent SIGTERM (how systemd stops its unit, and how `kill` ends it).
 *
 * The decision is whether a stop was asked. If one was (`task stop`, `ohmyagi stop`, the brake), the runner answers
 * as it always has: it stops, closes the task `stopped`. If none was — the user's manager going down at a reboot,
 * `systemctl --user stop om-agi-task-<id>` by hand — the runner leaves the task for `task resume`: the step's turn
 * is ended the same way, the step is closed as interrupted, and nothing is claimed about the goal.
 *
 * Two ways out if the runner cannot get there by itself: a second SIGTERM, and {@link TERM_HARD_EXIT_MS} after
 * the first, force the process to exit. Under systemd the unit's own `TimeoutStopSec` (60 s) sends SIGKILL first;
 * this is for a runner that is not in a unit.
 *
 * Pure of processes, so that both branches are unit-tested: what is asked of the world is injected.
