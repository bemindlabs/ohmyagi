/**
 * S1.6 AC5 — one identity's personal data must not appear in another's.
 *
 * D-011 calls this the most serious failure this system has: *ข้อมูลส่วนตัวของ
 * คนหนึ่งโผล่ในปากของ agent อีกตัว*. `test/guard/personal.test.ts` already
 * checks that two subjects resolve to two directories. This file checks the
 * property that actually follows from it, which is stronger and is the one AC5
 * asks for:
 *
 * - **every** path either identity resolves is outside the other's tree, at
 *   whole path segments, so `alpha` and `alpha-keeper` cannot nest;
 * - data planted under one is invisible to a walk of everything the other
 *   resolves — not filtered out, not found and skipped: not reachable;
 * - and there is **one** place in the engine — `src/` and `bin/` both — that
 *   composes a personal path, so the two properties above are facts about the
 *   address rather than habits of the callers.
 *
 * The third is the tripwire, and it is the only one that survives a refactor.
 * Nothing here unwraps a `Personal<T>` or reads a record's contents; the test
 * is about where bytes live, not what they say.
