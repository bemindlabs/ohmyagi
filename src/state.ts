/**
 * The one place om-agi is allowed to keep state outside a repository.
 *
 * Two things now live out here — the originals `soul apply` copies before it
 * writes, and the turn ledger (ADR 0002 §3) — and they landed here for the
 * same two reasons. Neither can be derived from what git holds, so `.dagi/`
 * would delete them on the next rebuild (I-2); and both are the owner's to
 * withdraw, so git, which remembers what it is asked to forget, is the one
 * place they must not go (I-4).
 *
 * The rule this file exists to enforce is narrower than "share a helper": the
 * two callers must agree on *the same root*, because `ohmyagi erase` (S7.2) has
 * to be able to name one directory and mean all of it. When the XDG logic was
 * written twice, the second copy was one typo away from a tree nothing would
 * ever look in again.
 *
 * Nothing here reads `process.env` or `homedir()`. Both arrive as arguments so
 * a test can point the whole tree at a temporary directory and be certain it
 * did — the same reason `ApplyEnv` exists.

 * is a fact, and `git clean -fdx` and `cp -r .` both prove the difference.

/**
 * The two things no `forget` and no `purge` under either root can reach,

 *
 * I-4 has two halves and the second is the one that is usually skipped: *do
 * not claim to delete what cannot be deleted*. `ledger forget` printed these
 * two lines first; S3.5's `observe purge` has to print the same two, because
 * they are true for exactly the same reason — and a second copy of the words
 * would be two copies to keep honest instead of one. The wording that differs
 * between callers is the only part that is a parameter.
 *
 * What om-agi deliberately does **not** do is overwrite the old bytes. On an
 * SSD, a journalling filesystem or a snapshotting one, a `shred` rewrites a
 * different block and leaves the original where it was: it buys no safety and
 * sells a great deal of confidence. What om-agi will say instead is what it
 * can actually check — search the tree afterwards and the text is not there.
 *
 * @param occupant What the freed blocks held, in the caller's own words —
 *   `"these lines"` for a ledger, `"these records"` for the observer.
 * @param tree The directory a snapshot would have copied, named the way the
 *   caller names it elsewhere in the same output.
