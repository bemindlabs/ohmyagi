/**
 * Two souls that exist only in a temporary directory, and share nothing.

 * D-021 says the engine carries no path, name or account of the owner and that
 * every fixture is synthetic. S1.6 needs more than synthetic, though: it needs
 * two identities whose facts are **provably disjoint**, because the whole
 * measurement is "B cannot say what A knows" and two souls that happened to
 * share a phrase would make a pass mean nothing.
 *
 * So the facts here are deliberately arbitrary sentences about fictional
 * procedures, and `sharedFacts` (`src/soul/isolation.ts`) is asserted to be
 * empty in both directions before any of them is used as evidence.
