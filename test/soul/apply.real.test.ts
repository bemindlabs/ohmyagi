/**
 * AC4 against the operator's actual instruction file — opt-in, and read-only.
 *
 * Run with:
 *
 *     OM_AGI_REAL_CLAUDE_MD=1 bun test test/soul/apply.real.test.ts
 *
 * Skipped otherwise, because it depends on a file that exists on one machine
 * and not in CI, and a test that silently passes when its subject is missing
 * is worse than no test.
 *
 * What it does: reads the real file, copies it into a temporary home, applies
 * a fixture identity *there*, and checks that stripping om-agi's block gives
 * the real file's bytes back. The real file is never opened for writing, and
 * its path is computed from `$HOME` at run time rather than written down (a
 * path in the engine would be a person's path in the engine — D-021).
 *
 * The synthetic case lives in `apply.test.ts` and runs everywhere. This one
 * exists to catch what a fixture cannot: whatever is actually in that file
 * today, including whatever another tool has written into it since.
